If we can carry out intelligent monitoring, quarentine, and prevention protocols between now and sometime in May, we should be at a point of enough sunlight and heat to halt the spread of the virus much farther, at least until the fall (typically October). The question then becomes if we've been able to identify effective antivirals to assist infected high risk patients (possibly) and/or have rushed a vaccine to market (probably not--human trials take too long) in the gap between May - October in preparation for the resumption of the cold weather. So I think there *is* a realistic scenario where this thing stays contained at least during the front half of the year, assuming there is sufficient action by public health officials.

Personal NPIs which include personal protective measures you can take every day and personal protective measures reserved for pandemics. Community NPIs which include social distancing measures designed to keep people who are sick away from others. And school closures and dismissals. And environmental NPIs which includes surface cleaning measures. NPIs routinely recommended for prevention of respiratory virus transmission include everyday personal protective measures. These are preventive measures we recommend during influenza season. These NPIs are recommended during a pandemic regardless of the severity level of the respiratory illness. Personal protective measures reserved for pandemics include voluntary home quarantine of household members who have been exposed to someone they live with who is sick. Now I'd like to talk through some examples of what community NPIs look like. These are practical measures that can help limit exposure by reducing exposure in community settings. Students in smaller groups or in a severe pandemic, closing schools and using internet-based teleschooling to continue education. For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase teleworking options. On a larger scale, communities may need to modify, postpone, or cancel mass gatherings. None of that is occurring in Chicago right now. At most, people in charge are making plans (as should you, in terms of telecommuting or keeping your kid at home).\n",

Most people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory frequency >=30/minute, blood oxygen saturation <=93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates Mortality increases with age, with the highest mortality among people over 80 years of age (CFR 21.9%). The CFR is higher among males compared to females (4.7% vs. 2.8%). By occupation, patients who reported being retirees had the highest CFR at 8.9%. While patients who reported no comorbid conditions had a CFR of 1.4%, patients with comorbid conditions had much higher rates: 13.2% for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer. LINK Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told The Wall Street Journal that \"it's likely we'll see a global pandemic\" of coronavirus, with 40 to 70 percent of the world's population likely to be infected this year. (CDC states 32M to 45M get the flu every year. USA has 327 million people. 327,000,000 x .4=130 Million corona infections.) Prof Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University, says if the transmission estimate of 2.5 additional people for each infected rate is accurate, that would result in an \"attack rate\" that would affect 60 to 80 percent of the world's population.

That's a selfish and short-sighted way to think about things, and it's hurting Americans. After Sanders dropped out I got called a shill for Hillary because I urged people to think about the long-term effects of a Trump victory, and they've mostly come true. Republicans didn't just get away with stealing the nomination that was rightfully Obama's, they managed a conservative majority on the court, as I had warned. This will affect SCOTUS decisions for the next several decades, or longer, if Trump gets a second term. The two oldest Justices are liberals, Ginsburg (86) and Breyer (81). The next oldest is Thomas (71), and Ginsberg has already had some health scares. So the chances are high that in the next four years at least one more seat will open up. Do you *really* want to give conservatives a *supermajority* on the Supreme Court? For the 30-40+ years? Keep in mind, this is the Supreme Court that Ginsburg has already accused of being politicized. The Trump administration just appeals every case up to the SCOTUS, which has decided in favor of conservatives 5-4 every time. You wanna give that to Republicans for the next several decades? Consider some of the decisions the court has made since Trump took office: * [Trump v. Hawaii]LINK allowing Trump to impose his \"temporary\" travel ban while its legality was being argued in court. * [Ohio v. American Express]LINK allows banks to use \"anti-steering\" tactics to coerce vendors not to direct customers to lower-cost options. * [Janus v. AFSCME]LINK overturned a 1977 SCOTUS ruling that made it so Unions could collect dues from people who benefit from their activities, even if they aren't a member. * [Bucklew v. Precythe]LINK allows the state to use an otherwise ordinary method of execution against someone, even if they have a medical condition that would cause them to experience otherwise cruel and inhumane pain. * [Rucho v. Common Cause]LINK ruled that gerrymandering was not an issue the SCOTUS could weigh in on. * [Hernandez v. Mesa]LINK ruled that a border guard, standing in the United States, who shot a child on the Mexican side of the border could not be sued.

Saying one school has a bad problem is not a statistically valid report, i.e. leads to the panic and misinformation you are arguing against. Read through the website, but in general, we have flu, and it is not great but not out of the ordinary. [CDC Flu Report]LINK This is similar to what has been seen at this time during recent seasons. I realize Minnesota may be worse than national, I don't want to dig that deep. My point is, this COVID is not flu and the prevailing narrative, that flu is worse than COVID and we don't need to worry about it is not true. People are not panicking at this time, you can go to any store, and shelves are stocked, people are going to work, and no one is panicking. That is my point. It is a major issue to think about. So then who will treat them, if we have the same number of medical personnel and many of those are getting sick, you can lay in bed extra beds set up in community centers, but with no treatment. Where do you get the supplies to treat them with? You reference Spanish Flu and Polio, those were not good times my grandparents let me know how gnarly that was, and my uncle had polio and it crippled him. My mother recalls specifically how bad the polio situation was. It was not a good scene. The best way to limit this from happening is to prevent it from being spread, which requires the government to make reasonable limits to travel, congregating, and so on to keep the transmission under control. But they don't want the stock market to crash, and the financial situation of their political donors to suffer, so they won't... Someone just has to call it for what it is, that is the bottom line.

So I would suspect that if it ends up as a pandemic here in the US, that it will be more deadly than you are projecting, even. I think you're misunderstanding my views. I'm aware of heard immunity, and I'm not opposed to vaccines. I'm not an anti-vaxxer myself. Where my objection lies is in setting the dangerous precedent that it's ok to enforce against people's will that they must take state mandated medication. Vaccines are just the easy way to sneak in that precedent, since it's very hard to argue against something that should be common sense. It's not that Democrats lead to economic success, but rather that economic success leads to people voting Democrat. Not happy about it. This is an issue where I differ from the Libertarians, actually. I think it would be better if a larger portion of our tax revenue came from tariffs instead of from domestic taxes. They're first and foremost a tax on large multinational corporations, and while that does get passed on in prices, sometimes those prices are artificially lowered by foreign manufacturing that can take advantage of the lack of environmental or workers rights regulations abroad. But of course the interesting thing is how Trump uses the tariffs, which is as a bargaining tool. He's using the weight of the American economy to get what we want from the rest of the world. I think it's great that we have someone in power that knows how to do that. In what way? Lowered taxes? Again, I'm in favor of shifting tax revenue from internal taxes to tariffs.

When you inhale particles, whether it be from someone sneezing/coughing near you, or by touching your nose while you have bits of virus-laden mucus on your hands (from not washing your hands), your nose acts like a high-powered jet suction that warms and rapidly funnels the air directly into your lungs.

It's not known to be an anomaly since they don't really know if 14 days is the max amount of time, they're just basing that off the fact that previous coronavirus' were around 14 days and they have proof that it's been 2 weeks for some. It's not an anomaly if you don't really know the incubation period, and even if it is an \"anomaly\" it still means the virus can have an incubation period of close to a month. NBC is also reporting that it could be longer. LINK Anecdotal? It seems to be a fact that there have been incubation periods longer than 14 days. I think you're misunderstanding what anecdotal means. Edit: we're already seeing that this isn't the same as previous coronavirus' as well. This one acts closer to HIV and Ebola the way it tricks the furin enzyme makes it 100-1000 times more contagious than SARS or MERS, so to be certain that it incubates the same as them when there are cases we know the period was longer is foolish.\n",

There are a handful of cases in the US and, with the exception of ONE person, there has been no community contact infection. 2. The one person who was infected in California is from Solano County, home to Travis AFB, the base that infected people from Asia were first brought to. The fact that authorities don't know for sure how he got it doesn't mean that the virus has spread far and wide. The odds are very good that he did get it from someone related to the people coming through the base. Yes, it's concerning that he has been able to infect other people, but there is no widespread contamination in the US yet. 3. The odds are good that it is a matter of when, not if, the disease will reach here, but it won't reach us in 2 to 4 weeks, not in massive enough numbers to close schools. 4. Even when it does reach here, closing schools won't matter. I lived through MERS and a swine flu epidemic in Korea. During the swine flu, the school I worked at closed for a week when the kids started to get sick. The end result was that the few kids who really were sick infected all the other kids because during the week off, nobody stayed home. OPS is a poor district, lots of single parent households, parents who cannot afford to take time off from work. If the schools close, a lot of kids will be home, unsupervised, and they will hang out with their friends. Schools open or closed, when it reaches here, kids are getting sick no matter what. Odds are that OPS will simply cancel all summer activities and life will go on as usual in the fall.\n",

We don't have a vaccine and we likely won't for at least a year, we don't have medicine to help it and are not sure if we will any time soon. We don't have enough resources to treat everyone infected by it. There would be very large economic implications from everyone sheltering in their homes and not working. Could it blow over quickly? Yes. But that's really only if we find a good medical cure for it. There isn't a question of if it will infect the US to a pretty large degree, it's a matter of when and how severe.

Nobody wants to shoulder that risk. Additionally, I don't think large events are how transmission would spike, but the transportation network itself. Someone with COVID-19 flies from NYC to Columbus to visit their family and walks through a crowded airport. They do everything people do in airports and maybe one or two other people catch it that way. One of those two flies back home to Charlotte, NC. Another connects through Atlanta to Denver. I'm handwaiving the period between infection and contagion since maybe those other two people were also flying in and stayed here for a few days while the virus incubated.

      "I know it sounds paranoic and improbable, but my girlfriend and I need to be tested for the coronavirus. Let me explain why. We get quite a few packages from China. Last week we got 3 packages from China, 2 from from Hubei province, both from business sources who are on lockdown. According to the CDC it is \"not probable\" that packages can carry the virus, and they \"don't think\" it can be trafficked that way. Very un-definitive. However on Sunday we both started to show the exact symptoms for coronavirus. At first we thought it was just Influenza A, but now we are in day #4 and its tangibly getting worse. She is throwing fever spikes of 103 and both of us are in the 'high risk group'; over 60, existing pulmonary conditions, etc. We tried to get an appointment with a local GP - she \"declined' (bitch!) Call us old and silly - but since there is no conclusive answer on whether package transmission is possible it seems logical to seek testing. Anyone know where/if we can get tested in Bloomington?\n",

But try not to panic and keep in mind that ~80% of cases resolve on their own with only cold-like symptoms and there have been zero cases in Indiana. I'm not saying we shouldn't take it seriously, but don't panic just yet. Sure, buy some hand sanitizer, but maybe don't be a dick and take the entire display so no one else can have any.\n",

      "UMKC Chancellor addresses coronavirus in email Feb. 27, 2020 To Our University Community: As news about the coronavirus, or COVID-19, continues to emerge from across the globe, we wanted to share with you some important information to help you stay safe and support others. It's important to note that both Kansas and Missouri continue to have no confirmed coronavirus cases. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, have said that clusters of infection are likely to arise in the U.S. The virus originated in China and is spreading across the globe. Travel to both China and South Korea is now restricted by the U.S. government, and no new university-sponsored travel to China or South Korea will be approved until further notice. In addition, clusters have arisen in Italy and Iran. UMKC is continuing to monitor CDC travel advisories. UMKC is working closely with our partners in public health to track the spread of the virus and preparing to respond swiftly if cases arrive here. A UM System committee with representation from all four universities is meeting regularly to assess the situation and recommend action as necessary. As many in our community plan to travel for spring break, we recommend that you monitor news sources and follow any regional restrictions that are put in place. Whether traveling or staying at home, it makes good sense to follow health and hygiene recommendations that can help prevent the spread of colds, the flu or the new virus. The CDC recommends avoiding close contract with people who are sick; proper handwashing; and covering your coughs and sneezes, preferably into your elbow or sleeve. If you feel sick and think you may have been exposed to the coronavirus, please call your health care provider first and talk to them about next steps. (Going into a clinic or ER first could unnecessarily expose others.) Although we encourage our entire community to be vigilant, it's just as important that we avoid discriminating against others because of their country of origin or race. As noted by the CDC, people -- including those of Asian descent -- who have not recently traveled to China or been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are not at greater risk of acquiring and spreading the virus than any others. Our hearts are with all those affected by the virus, and I encourage you to join us in being careful, as well as mindful of others, during this time. Sincerely, C. Mauli Agrawal, Ph.D. Chancellor\n",

The judges include cheese graders, cheese buyers, dairy science professors, and researchers from 19 nations and 14 states. Rebekah Sweeney, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association, which organizes the event, says their judges do a more detailed evaluation than other cheese competitions, with a 100-point scoring system that looks at 36 potential defects. The last time the competition was held in 2018, a hard sheep's milk cheese called Esquirrou made in France at Mauleon Fromagerie won top honors. It is imported by Savencia Cheese USA. This year's winner will be announced Thursday. One judge and 30 people from a Japanese university could not attend because the university didn't allow international travel [due to the new coronavirus]LINK Sweeney said.
