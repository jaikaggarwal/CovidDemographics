The agency said all nine had undergone a series of tests in a military hospital in the capital Brussels. Eight of them tested negative.  No details were given about the person who tested positive, but the agency said they were in good health and not currently showing any symptoms of the virus.  A further person, from Denmark, who had not been able to return home on Sunday, had also tested negative, the agency said.  Wuhan is the center of the newly identified coronavirus outbreak in China that has killed over 400 people, with more than 20,000 infected.

I notice it's being sent from Italy. I remember about the coronavirus in Italy, but I don't think much of it because it's in a small red zone under quarantine.  I look up the Amazon center out of interest. It's in Castel san Giovanni, 5km from the zone under quarantine. Meh, still not much to worry about.  This morning I'm reading the news on the BBC and I see that Amazon has just put two of its employees in Castel san Giovanni under quarantine because they got the virus. Ugh.  I read on the WHO website that it's safe to receive packages from China, but those got a long transit time. On another website I read that coronaviruses can survive for up to nine days on inanimate surfaces, but still there's a low probability that it would cause an infection.  Should I be worried or am I getting paranoid ? I don't care about catching the virus because I'm young and healthy but some of my loved ones are not.\",\n",

We are a campus consisting of multiple schools, and there have been complaints about space for years now.  The space issue is actually so bad that different grades have different lunch periods because our cafeterias would be too full. Now, wouldn't you say that our school is probably the place with the biggest crowds that us students go to on a daily basis? Isn't keeping the school open hypocritical considering they gave us the advice to avoid such crowds?   2. Students can still mass spread the virus, and come in contact with teachers and parents, grandparents too. Their second point seems plain invalid.  3. There's evidence that infected people don't always show symptoms, but still spread the virus.  All the advice they gave us seems pointless if they're keeping the school open... Thoughts?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hello guys,  I have a question regarding a health insurance in Belgium.  Short Info:  I was planning to come in Brussels with work. The contract I have is for work in my country, but I am allowed to come to client, in another country and work from there, so I would not pay any taxes in Belgium, as I pay them in my country and with that in mind I was not planing to have a medical insurance in Belgium.  But since WHO declared that COVID19 is pandemic, the health insurance for travelers that I planned to have would become useless in case of me getting sick with the virus.  So now, I try to get some information about getting a medical insurance in Belgium that would cover my expenses in case of getting sick with the COVID19, so that in worst case scenario of me getting sick, I would not have to pay a bill of thousands of euros.  Again, no local work contract, as I would keep my contract in my country, but I imagine I could pay money in order to get the insurance.  So what would be the procedure? Can I get the insurance? How much would it cost?   Do I have to pay in advance for medical services and after that to get the money from the insurance?  Do you have any advice for me?  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you very much.',\n",

It's quite crazy, it's only been 24 hours to be honest but the situation and the protocols has changed so many times on the hospitals end. My partner was in a 2 person room, first they just let the roommate stay there and then an hour later they had them al alone in a room, mouth masks, food at the door. Then they said they might send them home if their symptoms worsened, to be in home quarantine with me. Now this morning it's changed and now if their symptoms worsen they will tested and send them to the corona division.

Minimize everything except anything related with food and medicine. For all the rest, do only the minimum services as we usually do on a union strike.

       "  'selftext': 'There are two outcomes of the current situation. Either we will all say in two weeks that the government did not do enough and reacted way to late; OR this summer we\\'ll be having a bbq and a bonfire of toilet paper with all our dear family and friends, and laugh with the panic we had in early spring.   I sincerely hope it will be the latter. The only reason this will be reality is when everybody follows the orders of the government and goes far, far, beyond that.   It induces fear in me to see that people are attending the so-called \\'lockdown parties\\' with an attitude \"it\\'s technically not illegal yet, I am doing nothing wrong\". These people forget the essence of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 has not been informed it is only allowed to start infecting people after midnight. The virus does not care.   So please, take the precautions serious.   * Don\\'t put your children in school, this was one of the worst typical belgian compromises. When the children are sitting together in the school gym, it is arguably worse then when only 20 of them are sitting in one classroom.  * Don\\'t bring your children to their grandparent, they will be the first to die. Even if you have no symptoms and your children have no symptoms, you can (and will) spread this virus to the more susceptible individuals in our society. If you really can not work from home, take personal time off etc,... I would suggest to arrange something with a SMALL circle of parents in the same situation. If you have 4, or 6 people, they should be able to work out a schedule to take care of each others children. I know it is not easy.   * Don\\'t go hamstering everything, there is no need for that. This is not war, there is no supply chain issue. Potentially we will have to reduce some cheap plastic crap we import from china, and maybe eat pasta instead of potatoes, and maybe your favorite cabernet sauvignon will not be available,... but food will be provided. This is not war, there is nobody bombing our supply lines and warehouses.   * Avoid contact. Use your elbows to open doors in public. Use the wireless contact function of your bankcard to pay, and don\\'t touch the terminal. Press in the pin code of your bank card with the back knuckle of your finger, and desinfect/wash your hands afterwards. Don\\'t open your door for anybody. It does not matter if it is your dear aunt, or nice neighbour etc,... They might look healthy, but you can not tell. Better be safe than sorry.   * Follow governmental regulations about contacting our medical workers. Do a phone interview with the doctor first. Don\\'t go to emergency rooms. For many healthy people, the treatment is basically to stay at home, stay hydrated, and sleep it of. You\\'ll feel miserable for a couple of days. If, however, you are in a risk category (immunocompromised, lung patient, 60+ years old,...) notify your healthcare worker immediately upon the first doubt you\\'re displaying symptoms. Follow regulations strictly!  * Stay healthy and active at home, go running, go for a bike ride. But above all, do this alone, or with the people living in your house. Don\\'t gather for any reason at all. Use whatsapp video chat and skype to maintain social contacts.  * Be healthty, stay safe, and watch some netflix. We\\'ll get together, drink a beer and laugh with this post this summer. Please help me make this happen.',\n",

You'd expect people finally start realizing shit is about to hit the fan but it seems like some people still dont understand how precarious of a situation we are in.  Once we opened the shop there was a shitloads of people who wanted to pick up orders and repairs because they couldn't come on Saturday.  Since all the people came in at opening hour there was a bottleneck at the cash register.  People were totally disregarding the 1 meter rule, people were still paying cash, people were still touching things they shouldn't not necessarily touch.  During the day I had four customers age +50 - with a deathwish I presume - who came in like it was just another regular day with issues with their tablet and smartphone. They had been told by their kids to stay inside but they really needed their iPad. I never make a hassle out of it but handling any touchscreen right now is a nono for me since they are infection bombs.  None of those customers even cared to clean their screen before coming into the shop and I had to disinfect them with alcoholtissue before I was even willing to touch them.  Other people didn't get the memo since they were just browsing through the shop.  When they needed an item I changed my sales pitch to 'do you want to have it today, or do you want it delivered by tomorrow' since I assumed anyone crazy enough to come to a shop today would actually need something urgently. Several people casually responded they were just looking around  as if it was just another normal day.  After numerous complaints regarding customers not respecting the 1 meter rule and other precautions my company finally caved in and has decided to close all its shops starting tomorrow and went full eCommerce only.  The message I want to bring with this wall of text is:  #Close down non necessary shops immediately by governmental decree. It seems like normal citizens are not willing to adhere to the advice given by all medical experts for the last week. How hard can it be to keep 1 meter distance and stay in your kot unless it really needed?  /end rant\",\n",

I've heard her complain about this before years ago but it was never that bad until this whole corona craze and we had to stay home.   Her father was never really there for her as a kid and only started to pay attention to her once she became a teenager. Though he would sometimes squeeze her buttocks to annoy her or provoke her even though she often expressed how she didn't like it her father just laughed it off saying it was a joke. This started already when she was around 5 years old.  Now that our country is advised to stay at home it seems like her father has become worse, to the point that he'll actively seek her out (for example even when she tries to avoid him, he'll follow her). She's told her mother before and she only says she's overreacting and he is just trying to be funny (or something to that extent). Now note that her father doesn't do this to her mother at all and my friend has said on multiple occasions that if he wants to touch someone's butt he has a wife for that.   He also started to rub her back, but in a way you usually only do with a partner, or try to hold her hand, but saying it's like when she was still little and how they would walk across the street like that. As I said before, she's an adult and it makes her uncomfortable and she has said before that she doesn't like his behavior, but her parents would only respond that she's exaggerating and being an ungrateful brat.  As far as I know he's never tried to rape her or anything, but that doesn't make me any less worried that this is still a possibility if he doesn't understand that what he's doing is wrong on so many levels no matter if it's his daughter or not.  I've told her she should go to the police with it since this can be seen as sexual assault but she's afraid that her parents will kick her out of the house when they find out. Is there anything else she could do for her own protection?\",\n",

Many people are heroes for working overtime, going beyond what  is expected, taking care of each other, often times without any real support from the government. I have close ties to healthcare sector due work and family working in it, and all I can see everywhere is just a general lack of support.   The cry from the physiotherapy sector to become first line healthcare (go there without a useless doctors note to avoid problems a lot sooner), the cry from nurses for more money and budget, the cry from volunteers for better training material ...  The only ones taken care of and protected are the doctors themselves, especially the general practitioners. Now, in times of personnel shortage, do you think we take action and allocate budget? Well yes of course, she was very quick to introduce a 20 euro compensation for a consultation over telephone. That is just ridiculous, that money is about the hourly wage of a nurse and she is just giving it to doctors for a 5 minute phonecall.   Do you think physiotherpists or logopedists get mouth masks? Hell no, they need to get them themselves through the same channels as the general public. Do you think there were guidelines on how to handle patients? They came last thursday: if you see a sick patient, you need to call his GP and ask what to do. YEAH SO HE GETS 20 EURO AGAIN. Also, sick patients need to be sent home and if you are under convention you can't charge them. So the doctor gets 20 euro without seeing the patient, but you need to send the patient home, take all the risk without masks and not even get paid.  It is just so onesided, it angers me so much. Our healthcare the last years has been nothing but squeezed, but doctors are way better of than before. Thanks Maggie, as a doctor you did a great job as a minister of health.\",\n",

I however can't examine you nor is this a true consultation, so I might refer quite a few people to call their own GP as they know your history, meds etc.   Some general tips:   - No physical contact, keep some distance (~1.5m) - Wash your hands frequently - Keep at home/Blijf in uw kot - Don't hoard or hamster. There's also no need to raid the toilet of any wc rolls (like I had happen in my practice last week). - No knitting, no kleurenwiezen (for our non-Flemish friends: this is a joke)   More info and general telephone number:  - https://www.info-coronavirus.be/nl/  - https://www.sciensano.be/nl/gezondheidsonderwerpen/coronavirus  - Telephone: 0800 14 689  EDIT: I will try to answer questions as quickly as possible, depends a bit on how busy the practice will be tomorrow.

Obviously everyone who is still outside and comfortable, is someone who doesn't take it seriously. Stupid people are a given, but one person in particular got my attention.

       "  'selftext': ' *TL;DR: Don\\'t hoard more then you need, be mindful of going out multiple times for groceries stock up what you need to prevent going outside. We need to contain the pandemic not normalize it. For your safety, it is best to be careful and make lesser trips outside and especially to supermarkets that are now high infection zone areas.*    Let me first start by saying I do not condone unnecessary hoarding. People who buy 20x more than they actually need do not help the overall situation. There is a clear difference between overbuying and storing in for a pandemic. [It is officially advised by the WHO to AT LEAST store lastable food and even medication for 2 weeks.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf?sfvrsn=6d3578af_8) People who condemn ALL kinds of storing of food are a huge problem as they encourage the behavior of going to the supermarket more than needed.   Even if I get downvoted for saying this, I am going to defend this behavior as it is recommended to stock up for at least 3 to 4 weeks for pandemics. You do NOT want to be outside when the infections start piling up and a full lockdown is present. It is not only recommended but asked by your government and king to stay home! Doctors and essential employees are risking their health begging you stay home and people are talking about doing casual groceries 2/3 times a week. That\\'s insane if you are one of these people you are not taking this crisis seriously enough.     Not only that but you\\'re misinformed about the new guidelines.  [The new guidelines forbids a certain amount of people from entering the store.](https://www.vvsg.be/kennisitem/vvsg/coronavirus-actuele-informatie-en-richtlijnen) Right now there aren\\'t more people allowed in because only 1 person per 10sq meter is allowed in the stores. So if the store is 100sq meters, only 10 people can be in the store at the same time and only for 30 minutes max. That is why you have to wait outside until someone leaves. These posts about supermarkets being flooded are fake. *People see lines outside and assume people are hoarding, while it\\'s just the new guidelines taking effect.*   One thing many people instantly realized is that supermarkets will end up becoming high infection zone areas. Which is why these measurements are taking so seriously. You go inside and you will see how serious these supermarkets take it. The more people get infected the more likely it is you will bump into someone who is infected. The people who stockpiled for a few weeks are now least likely to be infected as they don\\'t have to go to the supermarket multiple times a week.   Also while I agree that people should not hoard more than they absolutely need, You have to understand that supermarkets start the day with 25% stock in-store to maintain their inventory throughout the day.  Most supermarkets let people above the age of 55/65 do groceries for the 1st 2 hours. They restock around noon and once around night to give everyone the chance to buy. Yes, you are going to see empty shelves, but you can easily ask an employee to grab something you need from stock.   Again, please do not consider doing \"normal\" groceries, but instead, stock up for a week or two while people try to contain this virus. These measures being taken, cripple the economy; people are losing their jobs temporarily and our health is at risk. The more you go to the supermarket the more likely it will become for you to end up infected, as the infection spreads more and more people you see outside will carry this virus.',\n",

I dont know how well those measures have perforated into the general media so I figured I'd post the general gist of them here to help inform the people who happen to have a court date during all of this.  The general TLDR: Unless absolutely necessary, you will not need to come to court. You are allowed to, but in that case it will be only you (and possibly your lawyer) and normal measures apply. Your court date may have been postponed alltogether so check in advance.  - If you have a lawyer  then they will represent you in court and you will not need to go to court yourselves. This includes the hearings and court proceedings where parties are normally required to appear in person even when they have a lawyer. Judge may decide your personal appearance is still necessary in which case the hearing will be postponed. Also your lawyer will probably tell you all of this stuff anyways, if you have specific questions call them instead.  **You are still (as always) allowed to go to your court hearing in person, but given the circumstances it is discouraged because of obvious reasons.**  - If you do not have a lawyer...  You will want to check out [this website here](https://www.rechtbanken-tribunaux.be/nl). Find your appropriate court and check what their measures are because they may vary from court to court (though only slightly).  If unsure, call the griffie/greffe to inform about your hearing. If possible have your letter of summons or dagvaarding close so you can give them their reference so they can find your case quickly, if not, at least the date of your hearing and names of parties involved. Keep in mind that most of them are currently operating with minimal staffing so there might be wait times.  - If you do show up to court...  keep the general distance rule in mind. Only you and your lawyer will be allowed into the building, any other family or friends will not be allowed in so dont bring them.   If you are not a party in a hearing you won't be allowed in except to turn in or pick up your drivers licence (police judge).  - Regarding police court  Most of these have blanket postponed all of their cases untill at least half of april, **but do make sure to check the website** because not all of them have as far as I know and they can always make exceptions. (You'll also know when the new court date will be, though you should also get a new summons for it).   - Regarding new cases...  If you're wanting to sue someone now you're in for some waiting. Gerechtsdeurwaarders are not allowed to initiate new cases untill half april. **In exceptionally urgent circumstances they can make an exception however** , your lawyer will ask the head of your local court for permission to do this if circumstances require it.  You can still set the steps in motion but will not recieve a court date before half april.  - Kids and co-parenting  As far as I'm aware you're still allowed and thus required to hand over your kids to the other parent when it is 'their week'. Obviously take the usual precautions. If either parent and/or kid is infected this becomes void and isolation is recommended, which is equally obvious and common sense.  - Regarding pro deo or first advice from legal assistance..  Visiting hours have been cancelled, though as far as I can tell all of them continue to operate via phone. Hours may differ so be sure to look up the information online beforehand, some require you to register or make an appointment for a phonecall.  - Regarding toilet paper...  I can tell you right now that ' art. 398 SW, het opzettelijk toebrengen van slagen en verwondingen; door op datum van .... maart een persoon een slag/duw te hebben toegebracht in de gang van de Colruyt/Aldi/Delhaize naar aanleiding van een geschil omtrent een pak toiletpapier' is a really fucking ridiculous sentence to read, even more so when that is the accusation on the dagvaarding.  So don't do that shit because a year from now, you'll feel really dumb when the prosecutor is reading the previous thing out loud in court, even more dumb when the judge asks you why the fuck you would do that over some toilet paper and then even dumber when he informs you that you're risking 8 days to 6 months of prison and a € 26-100 fine (times 8 ofcourse) for it. Better hope that roll of toilet paper was worth it.  Stay safe ~~out there~~ inside, dont buy out everything in your stores if you dont need to and take care of your lesser able bodied friends and family!\",\n",

We (Ministry of Privacy) were in contact this morning with Philippe De Backer, who (next to Maggie De Block) is leading the 'Data Corona Taskforce'. In this taskforce, there are various stakeholders (some more troubling than others).   They ensured us all data would be aggregated on postcode level, so individuals can't be identified. When asked if they want to pursue identification in a later stage, they insisted identification is a no-go for them. It is possible - if things get worse - they might want to activate 'districts' level instead of postcode-level.   Data is coming from all Belgian operators, 'anonimised', and then interpreted by Data Dahlberg Institue. They insured us they are an European entity (which is still to be determined) and have experience on data research with Ebola. They actually invited themselves over via an opinion in Le Soir. To us, the presence of this company is perhaps the most troublesome. Other players are the Belgian Data Protection Authority (GBA), government body 'Sciensano' and the operators.   It's too soon to come to definitive answers. It all depends on the scale of aggregation performed by the operators and the DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assesment) which we have requested. We hope we can make a final recommendation or opinion as soon as we have all relevant data. We must stay vigilant: 1/ how anonymous is this data really (keeping into account various research that proves that 'aggregated data' is not as anonymous as believed, and 2/ for further evolutions that could lead to identification of individuals.   If you have any insider information, please reach out to us via [tips@ministryofprivacy.eu](mailto:tips@ministryofprivacy.eu)   Thanks!   Matthias,   Ministry of Privacy.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hi all, first post. I don't know if this has been posted yet so sorry if I break any rules here.  As bad as it might be for some, I really don't think the lockdown will end after the 5th of april and here's why.  Firstly, the main target globally seems to be reaching the inflection point of the growth factor for new daily cases. As it stands right now, that growth factor is about 1,15 - 1,25 for Belgium. That means that the amount of official new cases per day is multiplied by 1,15-1,25 and that happens every day. For example, on thursday we had 309 new cases and on friday we had 391. So the amount of new cases has grown by circa 1,26 (=391/309). If this continues, Belgium will have 30k to 80k infected cases (officially) by the 5th of april. The real number will be much higher. So, how does stopping the lockdown at that moment solve anything?  Obviously though, the measures taken by the government should decrease the growth factor. But, it will be hard enough to get that growth factor to 1 before the 5th of april and even if that happens, it will simply rise again if measures stop after the 5th of april because, if there are still some infected cases by the 6th of april, the virus will just be able to spread again from then on.   So, I expect this lockdown to continue for at least another month or 2.   I'm not a doctor, epidemiologist, virologist or whatever. These are simply my thoughts. What do you guys think?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"As my question could be relatable to other users, I'm looking for some juridical clarification.  Upcoming weekend, we (some friends) had a trip planned to the Ardennen to attend a Trail run. We booked a vacation home there to stay for the weekend. The cost was 250 euro and a guarantee of 250 euro. Three days before the corona measures were announced, we transferred the full amount.  Due to the Corona measures which states that unnecessary transport is prohibited, we contacted the owner of the vacation home to tell him we needed to cancel due to the measures.   He replied us back he would transfer the guarantee back but can't pay us back the rest as in his opinion, we cancelled the stay and as the contract mentions, he is not obliged to pay us back in case of  cancellation by the bookers. Our opinion however, is that it is not our decision to cancel the stay. We are forced to cancel the booking as we would be in violation with the measures. We understand it's a confusing time for everyone and mailed him with an offer to pay us back only half of the price of the stay (125 euro) so he has some sort of compensation for the effort he has put into this. We haven't heard him back yet (mail was sent 3 days ago).  Anyone has a more juridical view on this? I'm not interested in opinions, as we all have those, but I'm looking for more, well argumented answers.  Thanks and keep safe, fellow redditors!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Here's some good, practical advice for all of us to get through the lockdown without going nuts.  **Accept the facts**  Lockdown is hard on humans. Some parts of the world have a lot more experience with this than we do. Their research is clear: lockdown is hard. This whole situation is putting a shitload of stress on all of us. If you don't take proper care of yourself, you will go mad.  Symptoms of lockdown-madness include anxiety, irritability, insomnia, depression and many others. You probably already notice this in yourself or others. Now is the time to take extra good care of yourself. This is hard.  **The media is your enemy**  The stream constant updates all across the media is driving you insane. It's a normal reaction to want more information during stress, to know what to do to keep safe. But in this case pretty much everything is outside of your control. Follow the measures from the governement, and that's it. All you need is 30 minutes a day from a reliable news source to stay up-to-date. Everything else will not inform you better, it will just drive you crazy. This subreddit is terrible, btw, with people posting a new corona-related article every 15 minutes. Other social media sites are just as bad. In fact, you would do well to avoid social media these days as much as possible.  **Find something to do**  You need to do something productive. Paint, draw, build somthing, learn a new language, play a videogame. Spring clean your entire place. Declutter. Wax your car. Clean your bike. Read a book.  **Relax**  Relaxation exercises work. Do them when you feel stressed. Breathing exercises, mindfullness, youtube-yoga.  [Breathing exercises in particular are very effective at calming yourself down in a matter of minutes.](https://www.healthline.com/health/4-7-8-breathing)  **Move your body**  You are allowed to go out every day to move. Walk, bike, run. Do this. Every day. Find someone to go with if you live alone. Keep your 1,5 m distance, but do it. You need to go out every day, and you need to move every day. Get the body up and running.  **Stay in touch**  Videocall your friends / family every day. Stay in touch. You need this. Especially if you live alone. Otherwise the loneliness will drive you insane.  **Things to remember**  * Follow the rules of the lockdown, help people when you can, and let the experts handle the rest. * Belgium has one of the best medical systems in the whole world. *(Remember to vote for parties who want to keep this system. Remember that a lot of right-wing parties have been trying for years to destroy our public healthcare system and turn it into a profit-machine like in the USA.)* * Our government is acting on the advice of reliable experts. * We are not being lied to. *(Marc Van Ranst himself said on television 2 weeks ago that he had underestimated this epidemic. The people in charge admit their mistakes. This is good. It means we can trust them.)* * We are not being left to fend for ourselves. We get unemployment money, we get healthcare. * We will get through this.\",\n",

Came up with a couple myself, would love to see more / have a discussion.     * remote work: I know companies who are now forcefully discovering the benefits of working from home, they would never implement it themselves and have all sorts of excuses. What if the government makes this a permanent thing: everyone who can has to work at least 1 or 2 days / week from home (maybe set a required amount of days for each month/year)? Imagine how this would reduce the strain on our roads, with a reduction in air pollution and possibly a reduction of the stress-levels (life/work balance) as health benefits. * digitization in general:  companies who still do business the old way with lots of paperwork are now all in a sudden forced to go (almost completely) digital and need to find solutions * digitization in education: my sister is a teacher, and from what I hear most of the teachers are only now starting to discover the massive possibilities/opportunities several of these learning platforms have. I can only speculate what the outcome would be here, but the fact that all teachers are now sort of required to look into it is a win in itself.  * electronic payments: I live in a small town, 25k people, ... and still can't pay by card at the doctor, dentist, small grocery store (to dodge taxes) and most of the pubs (not convenient). Until 1,5 year ago same story with my fysio. Until I explained that they could just install an app on their tablets so people can pay by phone, something they implemented overnight, same story with my favorite pub owner. Well guess this crisis gives the opportunity to the government to force every business to accept cards/e-payment.  * HoReCa: I'm a (silent) member of the Unie Belgische Horeca FB-group and saw numbers being mentioned the other day: Belgium allegedly has way more pubs per capita than the countries surrounding us. How hard this might be, if a number of those were to fail due to this crisis, it might strengthen the position of the ones that will survive. Or in other words: the natural selection now happens within a couple of months, whereas this would normally take up years. * Despite the fear for the virus and all the lives lost, I can imagine that this forced break from the ratrace might have some smaller positives: I noticed increased solidarity, people are re-learning what it is to be patient again, maybe we start to realize that we shouldn't take everything for granted, ...\",\n",

Due to corona, they can't intervieuw the fathers themselves, but the project is due in a month)   [https://odisee.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\\\_bClz7kFCgntFBnn](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fodisee.eu.qualtrics.com%2Fjfe%2Fform%2FSV_bClz7kFCgntFBnn&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C593f9271a8f3452f1d6808d7d48b29a3%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637211566467571463&amp;sdata=HLXRHLRHqk%2BXbGBGLjsD%2FHa0WiPgd9Dl44U%2BcgcpxY0%3D&amp;reserved=0)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hey guys i\\'m asking this on here to see if i\\'m going out of line with a certain professor at a flemish university.   I\\'m currently enrolled in a tax-law course. Normally all of our textbooks are supplied to us at a \"student friendly price\" through a bookshop on campus.   Recently the professor in question made it clear that we must purchase a tax law codex to pass his course, this codex costs about 155 euros! The reason it\\'s so expensive is because we must buy the codex from the normal bookshop (there\\'s no deal in place to provide it cheaper for students).    Because of the coronavirus i have no job atm + i have to pay for my kot which is empty atm, because yeah there\\'s no university atm. I\\'m unable to afford a textbook of 155 euro\\'s in short.   I had to request special permission to un enroll the course. The dean granted permission. However the professor got very mad, in fact so mad that he proceeded to make a mad tweet about me.   Am i going out of line here? I simply can\\'t afford a codex of 155 euro\\'s + he didn\\'t add the codex as official \"studiemateriaal\" on the course information page so i was unable to know that i was gonna have to buy it beforehand.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I'm interested in philosophy and ethics but never really studied it, however I am interested in what other people see/know/think about the specific topic of 'guidelines' for doctors in case the pandemic gets really bad and doctors have to choose who to save and who to let die.   First of all I want to say that it is not an unicum as I can imagine people working in war zones are making similar decisions on a daily basis and there the 'enemy' is another human being so I can imagine the psychology being a bit different than in these times.   Secondly, I'm not following all the news about all the different countries but it would be interesting to see how other countries deal with it as I believe the ethics are an important indicator of how a society thinks. For example more 'liberal' countries vs. more catholic/conservative ones or more capitalistic vs. more communistic etc. And to see if the differences in how they deal with this, is in line with one of the other divisions or if it's a completely 'new' dimension.   So as for Belgium, we were kind of 'lucky' that we had a bit more time to prepare and the ethical board of doctors made some rules about 'prioritisation' IN CASE we would be at maximum capacity and doctors have to choose who to 'give' a place on a breathing machine. I'll try to summarize them but here's a full article about it (in Dutch/French: [https://www.despecialist.eu/nl/nieuws/coronavirus-les-hopitaux-appeles-a-poser-des-choix.html](https://www.despecialist.eu/nl/nieuws/coronavirus-les-hopitaux-appeles-a-poser-des-choix.html) or dutch: [https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/03/19/ethische-richtlijn/](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/03/19/ethische-richtlijn/)).  \\\\- Focus should be on chance of survival ànd quality of survival  \\\\- No different treatment for Corona-patients or other patients  \\\\- In case of exactly the same medical 'state', younger people will be prioritised (but young people with 'worse' prognosis won't get the spot until they are in a similar state as the older person or something (not totally clear what they mean with this))  \\\\- First come, first served  \\\\- Should always be a group decision and not taken by 1 doctor only (objectifying by having the hospital's ethical commission evaluate it).   To me this all seemed quite logical and there is also no mentioning of people with underlying conditions or diseases so it seems they would get priority (in Belgium) if they're medical situation is worse.   &amp;#x200B;  In NL however, the debate took a very different direction (it seems) and some people are arguing for social darwinism claiming that it's natures way to reduce populations etc. (article in dutch) [https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/ik-wil-geen-publiek-debat-over-wanneer-jij-mij-mag-laten-doodgaan\\\\~bebfc97b/?utm\\\\_campaign=shared\\\\_earned&amp;utm\\\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\\\_source=twitter](https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/ik-wil-geen-publiek-debat-over-wanneer-jij-mij-mag-laten-doodgaan~bebfc97b/?utm_campaign=shared_earned&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter).   I was quite shocked reading this but then I learned a bit more about the system in NL and in general they try to go more for a qualitative life-ending than trying to lenghten the age span considerably. So while in Belgium a lot of old people will use ICU units, in NL they receive palliative care and thus won't take up space in the hospitals. ([https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/03/27/medisch-ethica-erasmus-mc-we-moeten-wellicht-vaker-zeggen-we-behandelen-niet-a3995130](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/03/27/medisch-ethica-erasmus-mc-we-moeten-wellicht-vaker-zeggen-we-behandelen-niet-a3995130))   &amp;#x200B;  In a way I feel this might also be linked to the euthanasia 'debate' as it also implies questions about having a 'worthy' life-ending. Eg. would you prefer spending 3 weeks on an ICU unit not begin able to receive visitors and then die or spend 2 more weeks in your house where your relatives can visit (with of course social distancing measures and all still in place)?   At least I feel patients should have the option to not want to receive treatment but I don't know how this works in Belgium (or in other countries).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry if it's a bit chaotic but I just want to know other people's opinion about it, or if some 'philosophy' students can link my thoughts to some philosophical theories, go ahead :D So far I only got social darwinism out of it :p.   &amp;#x200B;  Tl; dr: doctors will face hard questions if capacity is full and they need to choose who to treat and how to 'decline' or 'let die';   \\\\- how do different countries deal with this?   \\\\-And what is your personal opinion about how doctors should decide?   \\\\-And last but not least, do patients have a chance to also state their preference or are they mostly ignored in the decision-making process?   Any philosophical theories about this, are very welcome :D   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks for my daily dose of philosophy or something \\\\^\\\\^\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I know there has been said a lot about Covid-19, its measures that are too soft or too hard, De Crem trying to install a police state, ect. I think it might be interesting to give my fellow Belgian redditors a perspective from \\'our\\' side of the story. I\\'ll try to keep my personal opinion aside as much as possible, and give an objective image about how things are going.  First of all: it have been really crazy days for police services since the measures started. Shifts look completly different, doing border control, patrol to see if all people keep social distancing, ect. My working scheme is a complete mess and we hardly know which shift we\\'ll have to work the next day.   So, as said, things are almost completly different now. We see quite a lot good effects like less car accidents, less burgarly (as almost everyone is home), no thefts (as all shops are closed). The \\'criminal\\' aspect of the job is almost completly gone.   It all shifts into the direction of maintaining public order. I must admit, as I work in quite a rural department, most people keep the measures in mind. But what is really remarkable is how big social control is. Our shifts are filled with this kind of calls:  * \"My neighboor has visit\" * \"I\\'m walking on the street and see light in this pub\" * \"I just passed by a \"frietkot\" and there were 3 people waiting in there whilst the place is way too small\" * \"I\\'m in the park and 3 children are playing ball games here\" * \"People are eating ice cream and sitting on the bench on the town square\"  As already said, I\\'m not going into opinions on these situations or whatsoever but for police, it is really difficult to be on time to make the right observations. There is really an overload of similar calls and shifts are filled with driving from the ice cream eaters to the parksitters, back to the too packed \"frietkot\".  Also, there still is a lot of confusion about the interpretation about some measures, even for the police. There is the MB (Ministrieel Besluit) which states what can and what not. But the crisis center of the Belgian Government also made a sort of \"guide\" or \"FAQ\" for police with some additional information about the measures. Wouldn\\'t it be Belgian if there are contradictions between those documents?  You sometimes can\\'t imagine how complex situations can become due to the measures. For example: a French farmer has an small car accident whilst being on the road with a bull to go impregnate a cow of a Belgian farmer. You see my point?  We understand the measures will get a \"light version\" within a few weeks but things will get more complex for police to make the right observations. For example: the fact that parents can now make a car trip with young children (&gt;5 years)for recreational purposes is one the newest measures. I\\'m happy for those families but for police, this a difficult situation. Let\\'s say we do a traffic control on a car with a family. Mother and father in the front. On the backseat a kid that looks 6-7 years old. Kids at that age don\\'t need an ID-card so we\\'ll need to contact our transmission center, run one of the parents through an ID check to conclude the kid is (not) old enough for this trip.   Another thing is the border control. To put it short: this is pure deception to the people. We have a border with France. Due to shortage on personnel, the border crossings are only controlled on daytime. At night, the border is almost completly open for anyone. For French citizens to cross the border, they need a document with information about e.g. their Belgian employer or invitation. Though, these documents are free to find online and are filled in handwritten and need 2 signatures (one of the employee and one of the employer). Who the hell knows if those signatures are correct? It is just one big shit show that takes up a lot of capacity of police services and has almost none or zero added value to the situation.  There\\'s only one thing I want to give my opinion about: De Crem using the crisis trying to install a police state. Tbh I laughed really hard when I saw this was one of the headlines in the media. First of all: De Crem has almost no idea what he\\'s talking about. A few days back, he even said in a TV interview that \"politie en rijkswacht hun uiterste best doen.\" (translated: police and gendarmie are doing their best). Small note: the gendarmerie is disbanded almost 20 years ago. So yeah, this guy has evil plans to install a police state... /s.  Imo the reason the \"kliklijnen\"were introduced is because the police dispatchings are overloaded with calls like I mentioned above. So, in fact, this is a phenomen created by the community itself.  The drones thing on the other hand, is probably the idea of an opportunistic chief somewhere on the higher levels of police or something that has been asked by a local mayor or governer.   So, I hope some of you have better idea now about how things are going on \\'our\\' side. Anything else you are wondering? AMA except opinions on certain matters.   Thanks for reading and y\\'all stay safe!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"(RANT)  TL; DR: Husband's employer knows my husband suffers from HIV and is strongly advised by his specialist doctor to work from home and self quarantine. Boss gives him a hard time about not coming to the office.   So, my husband has had a diagnosis for HIV since jan 2015.  He was very, very ill since nov 2014 . Had a double pneumonia, constant fever, thrush, etc. Didn't respond to any treatment.  At last in jan 2015 we had the devastating diagnose of AIDS. CD4 were almost zero. His body was on the verge of giving up and had only weeks left if he didn't get treatment quickly and responded to it. Luckily he did and slowly recovered. 5y later he is very healthy, but is ofcourse 100% dependend on his HIV medication and is at risk for several health issues.  And so Corona happened.... Husband works in a shared private practice for mental health workers in Brussels since 2017 (psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, ...for mostly patients with foreign roots), but in administration: taking phone calls, organising appointments, handles bills, places orders, etc... Doesn't see any patients. Boss is a 58y old psychologist.  The work organisation is very old school: everything printed out on paper, paper files of the patients info,  everybody works strictly 9-5 etc. An Excel sheet was the summum of digital work.  March 13: Lockdown is enforced and working from home advised.  His office understandably wants to keep working during Corona times. However, they don't provide any safety measures except 'our building is big enough to spread out and keep 1,5m apart'. Husband gets scared because 1) he is seriously immuno compromised and 2) his office is the central point of the building: small but also provided with the printing machine, coffee machine, water tap,..... It's also the place where every patiënt passes through on their way to their appointment. Mostly foreign roots of which 75% hardly speak Dutch, French or English.  Everybody constantly passes through this tiny space and very close to him. 3) he commutes to work by public transport. Cramped spaces and sick people don't match well in Corona times.   So husband consults his specialist in UZ Brussel and he strongly advises to stay home.  Informs hiss boss of this in person and also tells him why. Very big step for him, because he told no one except our closest relatives.  Boss has no reaction of empathy whatsoever, but questions the necessity because ' they can sit 1,5m apart'. Working from home is perfectly possible for my husband and most colleagues with a little bit of digital effort (he has numerous tasks he can work on for weeks, can make appointments from home, pay bills etc. He even had Zoom set up for all the colleagues which they now use daily for meetings. Several colleagues have started doing online meetings with patients since they've seen the advantages and also prefer not to go the office frequently.)  Boss however is not happy. Doesn't outright say husband should come in but states 'that his colleagues question his loyalty to the work place'. And 'I strongly believe some of us are totally overreacting'.  He is also moaning about  'these online meetings and appointments that were initiated without his approval'. At one point wants to stop using Zoom and move to MS Teams. Then stops this because Teams is too difficult ( he's a digital nitwit). Then wants to try another platform that he has my husband working on, trying out and installing for 4 days, then is silent to every mail or phone call for 3 days and then states that he decided not to use this anyway right after giving this assignment to my husband but forgot to mention this earlier.  He acts as a kid who didn't get his way and is now sulking.  Plus telling someone you have HIV is a huge step, a simple ' I'm sorry you have this' would have been more empathic then questioning if you're really immuno compromised enough to stay home.  I would have expected more from a psychiologist....!   RANT OVER!\",\n",

We haven't had to leave the house during all of this. Turns out, you can't order tobacco online. It's forbidden by law. What's the safest way to buy tobacco, then? There's either a nightshop, few customers, unsure about their standards relating to covid. A press shop, with significantly more people going in and out, possibly better standards. Or a supermarket, higher standards, disinfected shopping carts etc, but in the same closed space with many other people at once. I feel so lost. I've been stretching my reserves, went from being a chimney to 5 per day just to get my nicotine hit somewhat reliably. But I don't see this thing ending anytime soon, and probably getting worse the longer I wait. So I'll definitely have to go out and get supply for a few months.   What would you recommend? Personally I'm leaning towards night shop. Least contact with people. Put everything in a bag. Disinfect bag and products once I'm back inside. Strip near the door, leave clothes there for a week or two before taking them inside the living area, shower and then settle back into my inside routine?   I feel like shit for having to go out for tobacco, but I'm literally freaking out over it. My depression started setting back in a few weeks ago, but I don't want to risk seeing a doctor either. I'll go bonkers if I have no more tobacco.   Is there any other option I'm not aware off that prevents having to go outside? I don't want to leave the house. But I see no other option... I'm really lost right now. Potatoes, meat, everything you can get delivered. But tobacco? Apparently not.\",\n",

I had an interview lined up and contacted numerous people but nobody responds to my mails anymore.  Therefore I turn to you, the users of /r/belgium   The criteria for the interviewee are as followed:  * 10 years of experience (at any job) * 5 years of experience in a management function * At least 5 employees (subordinates)  But if you are a few years off in terms of experience, I don't mind. I'm not really picky.  The topic of this interview is the management cycle (Plan, Act, Monitor, Review) and how you implement and use this. I will send you a full list of questions (8-12 questions) in front.   We can conduct this interview by mail or (video)call. Preferred languages are Dutch or English. I guess this woudn't take more than 15 minutes of your time.    So if you by happenstance turn out to fit the criteria and are happy to help a Belgian student, you can PM, post a comment or send a mail mgmtinterview@gmail.com  If you are wary of sending a mail to a random mail address, just send me a mail saying you're interested so I can respond with my academic mail to work out the details. I will need your real name and name of the company you work for, but I will contact you with my academic mail in case you sent me on the gmail address. That way, you don't have to use your reddit username in case that is sensitive to you.   I know these posts can be spammy on the subreddit, that's why I refrained from doing so but like I said, it has become hard to contact people in other ways.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Once the Corona lock-down ends, I might start looking for a new job in Belgium, assuming that the labor market will not be in shambles. My current job title is *data scientist*. I will be looking for a similar position as the one I have now, but with a different employer. I want to use this opportunity to increase my compensation, which I believe is currently below my value (more on that below). Hence, I was hoping that the hive mind would help me with approximating my market value. There is public information available on sites such as Glassdoor and Payscale, but the  spread is very wide and usually lacks context (candidate skill level, experience, etc..).  I would like to come to a realistic range that I can use as a baseline when negotiating my compensation. Below I provide some information about my profile.  ## Profile  ### Education &amp; experience  -   PhD in a quantitative discipline -   2-3 years of industry experience -   R&amp;D project management -   AI strategy consulting -   Machine learning     -   Multivariate time series forecasting     -   Computer vision     -   Unsupervised learning &amp; clustering -   Data engineering     -   Data store management         -   GCP cloud storage         -   MySQL         -   Postgres         -   MongoDB         -   BigQuery     -   Building ETL pipelines     -   Workflow scheduling &amp; orchestration -   Data science &amp; analytics     -   Translating data insights to non-technical audiences     -   Building interactive dashboards (animations, geo maps, etc..)     -   Building &amp; scheduling BI reports (Data Studio)     -   Monte Carlo simulations -   DevOps     -   App development (with Python)         -   Web         -   CLI         -   REST API     -   Microservice architecture (Docker &amp; Docker-compose)     -   Version control with GitFlow branching model     -   Testing (unit, property, integration) &amp; debugging     -   Continuous integration with Bitbucket pipelines     -   Deployment with GCP Compute &amp; App engines     -   Documentation (MkDocs)  ### Skills, knowledge &amp; the rest  -   Machine learning stack     -   Tensorflow (Keras)     -   Pytorch     -   Scikit-learn     -   XGBoost     -   PyMC3     -   Pandas     -   NumPy     -   MLflow -   Python -   Jupyter -   SQL -   R -   Bash -   Docker -   Selenium (beginner) -   Git -   Spark (beginner with PySpark &amp; Koalas) -   Bayesian inference &amp; econometrics -   I work well in a team and I am easy to work with, or so I hear.  ## Current situation  In a nutshell, in my own perception I am a mixture of a data scientist, a data engineer &amp; a Python developer. Currently I work at a tech startup, where I am executing all kinds of tasks, as is typical of a startup employment. This has been very rewarding, but I increasingly find that a majority of my time is being spent on managerial tasks and given how the company is situated, I do not see that changing any time soon. Therefore I would like to transfer to a bigger employer with mature data operations in place, where I can focus more on what I want to do - data science/engineering &amp; development. At the same time, I strongly suspect that given my skill set and experience I am underpaid relative to my comparable peers, so I would like to get that fixed when transferring to a new employer.  My current compensation consists of:  -   €3500 bruto salary -   maaltijdcheques -   phone subscription -   group insurance -   laptop  ## Requested input  Given this background, what kind of compensation package should I be aiming for? I am not settled on any particular industry yet (but flirting with tech research institutes &amp; fintech) and considering that industry context can significantly influence the level of compensation, please include this information as well if you judge relevant for this type of work.  Many thanks in advance to those willing to chime in!',\n",

My wife had to fill in some blanks for me since I appear to be deaf and have missed half of it, or maybe I was too caught up in Temptation Island whe it happened.  There was a loud bang in the street, then tires screeching, followed by a second bang and and engine revving. I only heard the second crash.  Some dude probably hit something with his car (didn't see what or where), sped off, cut a corner and got stuck on a traffic island after ramming a sign. Tried to wiggle himself off, gas open. Not going anywhere. All the neighbours watching through the windows or from their front doors.   Cops came, at least 3 combi's this time. Didn't really see, but I think they arrested him.  This place was calmer without a lockdown.\",\n",

By that time I'll have had three years of professional experience working in a business environment as a content creator/marketing specialist.  Meanwhile, my girlfriend has received the opportunity to go on a student exchange program to Brussels for a semester, starting in September, which she gladly accepted.   The plan therefore is to move to Brussels together, late summer: she'll be studying, and I'll be working.  Now, I'm on the job hunt already, and it's going pretty well. What I'm afraid of, however, is the second wave of coronavirus, which many people say will arrive, autumn. I'm not so much worried about getting sick myself - that can happen no matter where I am - but about the possible job losses resulting from the second outbreak. I'm afraid my position in the new company will not be stable enough to prevent them from retrenching me. I know that would happen in the country I'm living in at the moment.  So - what should I do? There's plenty of time yet, so I want to utilize it as effectively as possible. Perhaps I'm completely wrong on that and Belgian job culture is not as ruthless as elsewhere and I should not worry this much?   Help, guys, I really want to have the possibility to live in your country!\",\n",

(We started out with 8 or so, cause I knew some people were going to leave, this always happens when searching for people online.)   That being said: For now we have a solid group, where all players are eager to continue the campaign.  We play on sundays. For now (corona-lockdown) we are playing at 19.00-22.00 (via roll20). We have had a couple of sessions now (4 or 5), each during +- 3 hours, each time with a full group.  Why are we looking for +1? Since we want to play once every 2 weeks once the lockdown is over, and undoubtedly, it will occur that one is not available due to life happening. So, if one would be absent, we would still have 4 players left if we have a regular group of 5 players (+DM).   The sessions would be held in Deurne (Antwerpen), usually at sunday, afternoon - evening (hours could change, but it will be always on sunday, and since people work on monday, it won't be too late in the evening).   Who are the players in this group: Except for the DM, they are all new to PF. All but one had already (some more than others) experience in an RPG (mostly D&amp;D).  Age: 25 - 45, with an average of +-35  If interested, please let me know something.   PS: The campaign is home-brew, open-world.  Best regards  iNoob\",\n",

      "   BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Belgian person, one of nine repatriated from Wuhan in China on Sunday, has tested positive for the coronavirus, Belgium’s health agency said on Tuesday.  The agency said all nine had undergone a series of tests in a military hospital in the capital Brussels. Eight of them tested negative.  No details were given about the person who tested positive, but the agency said they were in good health and not currently showing any symptoms of the virus.  A further person, from Denmark, who had not been able to return home on Sunday, had also tested negative, the agency said.  Wuhan is the center of the newly identified coronavirus outbreak in China that has killed over 400 people, with more than 20,000 infected.

      "Hello everyone,  On Saturday I ordered something on Amazon with prime delivery in one working day. On Sunday I get a notification that it's been sent, delivery expected on Tuesday. I'm kind of surprised that it's been sent on a Sunday so I randomly check my order. I notice it's being sent from Italy. I remember about the coronavirus in Italy, but I don't think much of it because it's in a small red zone under quarantine.  I look up the Amazon center out of interest. It's in Castel san Giovanni, 5km from the zone under quarantine. Meh, still not much to worry about.  This morning I'm reading the news on the BBC and I see that Amazon has just put two of its employees in Castel san Giovanni under quarantine because they got the virus. Ugh.  I read on the WHO website that it's safe to receive packages from China, but those got a long transit time. On another website I read that coronaviruses can survive for up to nine days on inanimate surfaces, but still there's a low probability that it would cause an infection.  Should I be worried or am I getting paranoid ? I don't care about catching the virus because I'm young and healthy but some of my loved ones are not.\n",

We are a campus consisting of multiple schools, and there have been complaints about space for years now.  The space issue is actually so bad that different grades have different lunch periods because our cafeterias would be too full. Now, wouldn't you say that our school is probably the place with the biggest crowds that us students go to on a daily basis? Isn't keeping the school open hypocritical considering they gave us the advice to avoid such crowds?   2. Students can still mass spread the virus, and come in contact with teachers and parents, grandparents too. Their second point seems plain invalid.  3. There's evidence that infected people don't always show symptoms, but still spread the virus.  All the advice they gave us seems pointless if they're keeping the school open... Thoughts?\n",

      "Hello guys,  I have a question regarding a health insurance in Belgium.  Short Info:  I was planning to come in Brussels with work. The contract I have is for work in my country, but I am allowed to come to client, in another country and work from there, so I would not pay any taxes in Belgium, as I pay them in my country and with that in mind I was not planing to have a medical insurance in Belgium.  But since WHO declared that COVID19 is pandemic, the health insurance for travelers that I planned to have would become useless in case of me getting sick with the virus.  So now, I try to get some information about getting a medical insurance in Belgium that would cover my expenses in case of getting sick with the COVID19, so that in worst case scenario of me getting sick, I would not have to pay a bill of thousands of euros.  Again, no local work contract, as I would keep my contract in my country, but I imagine I could pay money in order to get the insurance.  So what would be the procedure? Can I get the insurance? How much would it cost?   Do I have to pay in advance for medical services and after that to get the money from the insurance?  Do you have any advice for me?  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you very much.\n",

It's quite crazy, it's only been 24 hours to be honest but the situation and the protocols has changed so many times on the hospitals end. My partner was in a 2 person room, first they just let the roommate stay there and then an hour later they had them al alone in a room, mouth masks, food at the door. Then they said they might send them home if their symptoms worsened, to be in home quarantine with me. Now this morning it's changed and now if their symptoms worsen they will tested and send them to the corona division.     So yeah, it's a bit unreal here, we're both isolated, suddenly thrust in the middle of this whole chaos, and I did not stock up on toiletpaper lol.\n",

But after taking a look to the several warnings about the data coming from the institutions studying the virus, I think it's obvious that we are now in a ramp up.

Minimize everything except anything related with food and medicine. For all the rest, do only the minimum services as we usually do on a union strike.  Create financial measures as in other countries to support this. Even the unions are somehow very quiet in this moment.   The virus as an R naught of 2-3, some scientists say 2-4. Which means that a infected person can infect 2 to 4 people. We will not be safe until we have a fully functional vaccine.

Either we will all say in two weeks that the government did not do enough and reacted way to late; OR this summer we'll be having a bbq and a bonfire of toilet paper with all our dear family and friends, and laugh with the panic we had in early spring.   I sincerely hope it will be the latter. The only reason this will be reality is when everybody follows the orders of the government and goes far, far, beyond that.   It induces fear in me to see that people are attending the so-called 'lockdown parties' with an attitude \"it's technically not illegal yet, I am doing nothing wrong\". These people forget the essence of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 has not been informed it is only allowed to start infecting people after midnight. The virus does not care.   So please, take the precautions serious.   * Don't put your children in school, this was one of the worst typical belgian compromises. When the children are sitting together in the school gym, it is arguably worse then when only 20 of them are sitting in one classroom.  * Don't bring your children to their grandparent, they will be the first to die. Even if you have no symptoms and your children have no symptoms, you can (and will) spread this virus to the more susceptible individuals in our society. If you really can not work from home, take personal time off etc,... I would suggest to arrange something with a SMALL circle of parents in the same situation. If you have 4, or 6 people, they should be able to work out a schedule to take care of each others children. I know it is not easy.   * Don't go hamstering everything, there is no need for that. This is not war, there is no supply chain issue. Potentially we will have to reduce some cheap plastic crap we import from china, and maybe eat pasta instead of potatoes, and maybe your favorite cabernet sauvignon will not be available,... but food will be provided. This is not war, there is nobody bombing our supply lines and warehouses.   * Avoid contact. Use your elbows to open doors in public. Use the wireless contact function of your bankcard to pay, and don't touch the terminal. Press in the pin code of your bank card with the back knuckle of your finger, and desinfect/wash your hands afterwards. Don't open your door for anybody. It does not matter if it is your dear aunt, or nice neighbour etc,... They might look healthy, but you can not tell. Better be safe than sorry.   * Follow governmental regulations about contacting our medical workers. Do a phone interview with the doctor first. Don't go to emergency rooms. For many healthy people, the treatment is basically to stay at home, stay hydrated, and sleep it of. You'll feel miserable for a couple of days. If, however, you are in a risk category (immunocompromised, lung patient, 60+ years old,...) notify your healthcare worker immediately upon the first doubt you're displaying symptoms. Follow regulations strictly!  * Stay healthy and active at home, go running, go for a bike ride. But above all, do this alone, or with the people living in your house. Don't gather for any reason at all. Use whatsapp video chat and skype to maintain social contacts.  * Be healthty, stay safe, and watch some netflix. We'll get together, drink a beer and laugh with this post this summer. Please help me make this happen.\n",

      "Today we opened our shop, after being closed for the whole weekend.  You'd expect people finally start realizing shit is about to hit the fan but it seems like some people still dont understand how precarious of a situation we are in.  Once we opened the shop there was a shitloads of people who wanted to pick up orders and repairs because they couldn't come on Saturday.  Since all the people came in at opening hour there was a bottleneck at the cash register.  People were totally disregarding the 1 meter rule, people were still paying cash, people were still touching things they shouldn't not necessarily touch.  During the day I had four customers age +50 - with a deathwish I presume - who came in like it was just another regular day with issues with their tablet and smartphone. They had been told by their kids to stay inside but they really needed their iPad. I never make a hassle out of it but handling any touchscreen right now is a nono for me since they are infection bombs.  None of those customers even cared to clean their screen before coming into the shop and I had to disinfect them with alcoholtissue before I was even willing to touch them.  Other people didn't get the memo since they were just browsing through the shop.  When they needed an item I changed my sales pitch to 'do you want to have it today, or do you want it delivered by tomorrow' since I assumed anyone crazy enough to come to a shop today would actually need something urgently. Several people casually responded they were just looking around  as if it was just another normal day.  After numerous complaints regarding customers not respecting the 1 meter rule and other precautions my company finally caved in and has decided to close all its shops starting tomorrow and went full eCommerce only.  The message I want to bring with this wall of text is:  #Close down non necessary shops immediately by governmental decree. It seems like normal citizens are not willing to adhere to the advice given by all medical experts for the last week. How hard can it be to keep 1 meter distance and stay in your kot unless it really needed?  /end rant\n",

Her father was never really there for her as a kid and only started to pay attention to her once she became a teenager. Though he would sometimes squeeze her buttocks to annoy her or provoke her even though she often expressed how she didn't like it her father just laughed it off saying it was a joke. This started already when she was around 5 years old.  Now that our country is advised to stay at home it seems like her father has become worse, to the point that he'll actively seek her out (for example even when she tries to avoid him, he'll follow her). She's told her mother before and she only says she's overreacting and he is just trying to be funny (or something to that extent). Now note that her father doesn't do this to her mother at all and my friend has said on multiple occasions that if he wants to touch someone's butt he has a wife for that.   He also started to rub her back, but in a way you usually only do with a partner, or try to hold her hand, but saying it's like when she was still little and how they would walk across the street like that. As I said before, she's an adult and it makes her uncomfortable and she has said before that she doesn't like his behavior, but her parents would only respond that she's exaggerating and being an ungrateful brat.  As far as I know he's never tried to rape her or anything, but that doesn't make me any less worried that this is still a possibility if he doesn't understand that what he's doing is wrong on so many levels no matter if it's his daughter or not.  I've told her she should go to the police with it since this can be seen as sexual assault but she's afraid that her parents will kick her out of the house when they find out. Is there anything else she could do for her own protection?\n",

      "Rant incoming  Healthcare is struggling these days. Many people are heroes for working overtime, going beyond what  is expected, taking care of each other, often times without any real support from the government. I have close ties to healthcare sector due work and family working in it, and all I can see everywhere is just a general lack of support.   The cry from the physiotherapy sector to become first line healthcare (go there without a useless doctors note to avoid problems a lot sooner), the cry from nurses for more money and budget, the cry from volunteers for better training material ...  The only ones taken care of and protected are the doctors themselves, especially the general practitioners. Now, in times of personnel shortage, do you think we take action and allocate budget? Well yes of course, she was very quick to introduce a 20 euro compensation for a consultation over telephone. That is just ridiculous, that money is about the hourly wage of a nurse and she is just giving it to doctors for a 5 minute phonecall.   Do you think physiotherpists or logopedists get mouth masks? Hell no, they need to get them themselves through the same channels as the general public. Do you think there were guidelines on how to handle patients? They came last thursday: if you see a sick patient, you need to call his GP and ask what to do. YEAH SO HE GETS 20 EURO AGAIN. Also, sick patients need to be sent home and if you are under convention you can't charge them. So the doctor gets 20 euro without seeing the patient, but you need to send the patient home, take all the risk without masks and not even get paid.  It is just so onesided, it angers me so much. Our healthcare the last years has been nothing but squeezed, but doctors are way better of than before. Thanks Maggie, as a doctor you did a great job as a minister of health.\n",

      " *TL;DR: Don't hoard more then you need, be mindful of going out multiple times for groceries stock up what you need to prevent going outside. We need to contain the pandemic not normalize it. For your safety, it is best to be careful and make lesser trips outside and especially to supermarkets that are now high infection zone areas.*    Let me first start by saying I do not condone unnecessary hoarding. People who buy 20x more than they actually need do not help the overall situation. There is a clear difference between overbuying and storing in for a pandemic. [It is officially advised by the WHO to AT LEAST store lastable food and even medication for 2 weeks.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf?sfvrsn=6d3578af_8) People who condemn ALL kinds of storing of food are a huge problem as they encourage the behavior of going to the supermarket more than needed.   Even if I get downvoted for saying this, I am going to defend this behavior as it is recommended to stock up for at least 3 to 4 weeks for pandemics. You do NOT want to be outside when the infections start piling up and a full lockdown is present. It is not only recommended but asked by your government and king to stay home! Doctors and essential employees are risking their health begging you stay home and people are talking about doing casual groceries 2/3 times a week. That's insane if you are one of these people you are not taking this crisis seriously enough.     Not only that but you're misinformed about the new guidelines.  [The new guidelines forbids a certain amount of people from entering the store.](https://www.vvsg.be/kennisitem/vvsg/coronavirus-actuele-informatie-en-richtlijnen) Right now there aren't more people allowed in because only 1 person per 10sq meter is allowed in the stores. So if the store is 100sq meters, only 10 people can be in the store at the same time and only for 30 minutes max. That is why you have to wait outside until someone leaves. These posts about supermarkets being flooded are fake. *People see lines outside and assume people are hoarding, while it's just the new guidelines taking effect.*   One thing many people instantly realized is that supermarkets will end up becoming high infection zone areas. Which is why these measurements are taking so seriously. You go inside and you will see how serious these supermarkets take it. The more people get infected the more likely it is you will bump into someone who is infected. The people who stockpiled for a few weeks are now least likely to be infected as they don't have to go to the supermarket multiple times a week.   Also while I agree that people should not hoard more than they absolutely need, You have to understand that supermarkets start the day with 25% stock in-store to maintain their inventory throughout the day.  Most supermarkets let people above the age of 55/65 do groceries for the 1st 2 hours. They restock around noon and once around night to give everyone the chance to buy. Yes, you are going to see empty shelves, but you can easily ask an employee to grab something you need from stock.   Again, please do not consider doing \"normal\" groceries, but instead, stock up for a week or two while people try to contain this virus. These measures being taken, cripple the economy; people are losing their jobs temporarily and our health is at risk. The more you go to the supermarket the more likely it will become for you to end up infected, as the infection spreads more and more people you see outside will carry this virus.\n",

They moved to brussels (a little outside), and timed it perfectly with the arrival of covid. Apart from their moving-truck being stuck in quarantine and a lot of other logistical challenge that makes their new home to which they are basically confined very barren, they also found themselves without internet and their prearranged installation date has been postponed until a month from now, if it will even happen then.  So are there some alternatives for them to consider? None of us understands the provider market in belgium. Are there any providers that have reasonable data rates for sim card and routers that can be used before the installation of fixed line internet in the indetermined future?

      "The PS that doesn't dare to rule with NVA, the MR that did everything to stop PS from getting in line with NVA to form a new government, just to keep all their ministers on post, VLD that postponed the president elections of the party just to give rutten some more time and keep lachaert from the momentum, knowing he has a different view on the party's course.   We have no decent prime minister. Every time she has to speak a word of dutch, she's prepped for an hour so she can read the paper right (tuesday she messed up, forgot to put the pages in the right order). It's a shame that our first female prime minister will be remembered for being a puppet figure. She's ought too weak by every political party but MR wanted to keep her on to save face.   We have a government that doesn't represents not even 25% of belgian population. All because PS and even more so Ecolo don't want to think about giving NVA a chance. But this alone wouldn't be too bad, but when magnette gave de wever an oral agreement, just to step back and nuke the deal on national tv without warning his colleagues is something I think just is another lack of respect to the largest party. But magnette does't care about the flemish people or belgium, given that this is the second time he spits in the face of a dutch speaking politician (remember Koen Geens).   NVA also was just plain stupid, with BDW proposing unrelated communautaire stuff while in the middle of a health crisis,  Frankly the only party that didn't fuck up this week was CD&amp;V and yet still I think they will be in the receiving corner when this all ends even though they were forced in this position.  Ah well. At least now we have a government that can keep on doing what they were before to fight the corona crisis: wait for France to act, and then imply the same, but a little bit modified, in Belgium.\n",

      "Like everything else, the courts and tribunals have also greatly adapted to the current situation, which means things are not business as usual there as you might expect.  I dont know how well those measures have perforated into the general media so I figured I'd post the general gist of them here to help inform the people who happen to have a court date during all of this.  The general TLDR: Unless absolutely necessary, you will not need to come to court. You are allowed to, but in that case it will be only you (and possibly your lawyer) and normal measures apply. Your court date may have been postponed alltogether so check in advance.  - If you have a lawyer  then they will represent you in court and you will not need to go to court yourselves. This includes the hearings and court proceedings where parties are normally required to appear in person even when they have a lawyer. Judge may decide your personal appearance is still necessary in which case the hearing will be postponed. Also your lawyer will probably tell you all of this stuff anyways, if you have specific questions call them instead.  **You are still (as always) allowed to go to your court hearing in person, but given the circumstances it is discouraged because of obvious reasons.**  - If you do not have a lawyer...  You will want to check out [this website here](https://www.rechtbanken-tribunaux.be/nl). Find your appropriate court and check what their measures are because they may vary from court to court (though only slightly).  If unsure, call the griffie/greffe to inform about your hearing. If possible have your letter of summons or dagvaarding close so you can give them their reference so they can find your case quickly, if not, at least the date of your hearing and names of parties involved. Keep in mind that most of them are currently operating with minimal staffing so there might be wait times.  - If you do show up to court...  keep the general distance rule in mind. Only you and your lawyer will be allowed into the building, any other family or friends will not be allowed in so dont bring them.   If you are not a party in a hearing you won't be allowed in except to turn in or pick up your drivers licence (police judge).  - Regarding police court  Most of these have blanket postponed all of their cases untill at least half of april, **but do make sure to check the website** because not all of them have as far as I know and they can always make exceptions. (You'll also know when the new court date will be, though you should also get a new summons for it).   - Regarding new cases...  If you're wanting to sue someone now you're in for some waiting. Gerechtsdeurwaarders are not allowed to initiate new cases untill half april. **In exceptionally urgent circumstances they can make an exception however** , your lawyer will ask the head of your local court for permission to do this if circumstances require it.  You can still set the steps in motion but will not recieve a court date before half april.  - Kids and co-parenting  As far as I'm aware you're still allowed and thus required to hand over your kids to the other parent when it is 'their week'. Obviously take the usual precautions. If either parent and/or kid is infected this becomes void and isolation is recommended, which is equally obvious and common sense.  - Regarding pro deo or first advice from legal assistance..  Visiting hours have been cancelled, though as far as I can tell all of them continue to operate via phone. Hours may differ so be sure to look up the information online beforehand, some require you to register or make an appointment for a phonecall.  - Regarding toilet paper...  I can tell you right now that ' art. 398 SW, het opzettelijk toebrengen van slagen en verwondingen; door op datum van .... maart een persoon een slag/duw te hebben toegebracht in de gang van de Colruyt/Aldi/Delhaize naar aanleiding van een geschil omtrent een pak toiletpapier' is a really fucking ridiculous sentence to read, even more so when that is the accusation on the dagvaarding.  So don't do that shit because a year from now, you'll feel really dumb when the prosecutor is reading the previous thing out loud in court, even more dumb when the judge asks you why the fuck you would do that over some toilet paper and then even dumber when he informs you that you're risking 8 days to 6 months of prison and a € 26-100 fine (times 8 ofcourse) for it. Better hope that roll of toilet paper was worth it.  Stay safe ~~out there~~ inside, dont buy out everything in your stores if you dont need to and take care of your lesser able bodied friends and family!\n",

      "So, I promised an update on various Reddit threads on the Belgian telecomdata being shared with the government, to combat the Coronavirus ([https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200320\\_04896707](https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200320_04896707)).   We (Ministry of Privacy) were in contact this morning with Philippe De Backer, who (next to Maggie De Block) is leading the 'Data Corona Taskforce'. In this taskforce, there are various stakeholders (some more troubling than others).   They ensured us all data would be aggregated on postcode level, so individuals can't be identified. When asked if they want to pursue identification in a later stage, they insisted identification is a no-go for them. It is possible - if things get worse - they might want to activate 'districts' level instead of postcode-level.   Data is coming from all Belgian operators, 'anonimised', and then interpreted by Data Dahlberg Institue. They insured us they are an European entity (which is still to be determined) and have experience on data research with Ebola. They actually invited themselves over via an opinion in Le Soir. To us, the presence of this company is perhaps the most troublesome. Other players are the Belgian Data Protection Authority (GBA), government body 'Sciensano' and the operators.   It's too soon to come to definitive answers. It all depends on the scale of aggregation performed by the operators and the DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assesment) which we have requested. We hope we can make a final recommendation or opinion as soon as we have all relevant data. We must stay vigilant: 1/ how anonymous is this data really (keeping into account various research that proves that 'aggregated data' is not as anonymous as believed, and 2/ for further evolutions that could lead to identification of individuals.

      "Hi all, first post. I don't know if this has been posted yet so sorry if I break any rules here.  As bad as it might be for some, I really don't think the lockdown will end after the 5th of april and here's why.  Firstly, the main target globally seems to be reaching the inflection point of the growth factor for new daily cases. As it stands right now, that growth factor is about 1,15 - 1,25 for Belgium. That means that the amount of official new cases per day is multiplied by 1,15-1,25 and that happens every day. For example, on thursday we had 309 new cases and on friday we had 391. So the amount of new cases has grown by circa 1,26 (=391/309). If this continues, Belgium will have 30k to 80k infected cases (officially) by the 5th of april. The real number will be much higher. So, how does stopping the lockdown at that moment solve anything?  Obviously though, the measures taken by the government should decrease the growth factor. But, it will be hard enough to get that growth factor to 1 before the 5th of april and even if that happens, it will simply rise again if measures stop after the 5th of april because, if there are still some infected cases by the 6th of april, the virus will just be able to spread again from then on.   So, I expect this lockdown to continue for at least another month or 2.   I'm not a doctor, epidemiologist, virologist or whatever. These are simply my thoughts. What do you guys think?\n",

We will be having these thread on alternating days to answer questions where posssible.  We are general practioners in Flanders which means prevention and assessment is our main job these days.  You can ask anything about the current corona outbreak, but keep in mind that a lot is still unknown and expert opinions shift quickly.  If you are unsure about what to do, leave a comment below and I'll try to aid you. I however can't examine you nor is this a true consultation, so I might refer quite a few people to call their own GP as they know your history, meds etc.  Some general tips:  * No physical contact, keep some distance (\\~1.5m) * Wash your hands frequently * Keep at home/Blijf in uw kot * Don't hoard or hamster. There's also no need to raid the toilet of any wc rolls (like I had happen in my practice last week). * Most cities/towns have a corona-triage centre set up. If you have any symptoms that need to be checked out call your GP, he will make an appointement for you at the right location. Don't go to the ER without consulting your GP if you can avoid it.

      "As my question could be relatable to other users, I'm looking for some juridical clarification.  Upcoming weekend, we (some friends) had a trip planned to the Ardennen to attend a Trail run. We booked a vacation home there to stay for the weekend. The cost was 250 euro and a guarantee of 250 euro. Three days before the corona measures were announced, we transferred the full amount.  Due to the Corona measures which states that unnecessary transport is prohibited, we contacted the owner of the vacation home to tell him we needed to cancel due to the measures.   He replied us back he would transfer the guarantee back but can't pay us back the rest as in his opinion, we cancelled the stay and as the contract mentions, he is not obliged to pay us back in case of  cancellation by the bookers. Our opinion however, is that it is not our decision to cancel the stay. We are forced to cancel the booking as we would be in violation with the measures. We understand it's a confusing time for everyone and mailed him with an offer to pay us back only half of the price of the stay (125 euro) so he has some sort of compensation for the effort he has put into this. We haven't heard him back yet (mail was sent 3 days ago).  Anyone has a more juridical view on this?

      "Here's some good, practical advice for all of us to get through the lockdown without going nuts.  **Accept the facts**  Lockdown is hard on humans. Some parts of the world have a lot more experience with this than we do. Their research is clear: lockdown is hard. This whole situation is putting a shitload of stress on all of us. If you don't take proper care of yourself, you will go mad.  Symptoms of lockdown-madness include anxiety, irritability, insomnia, depression and many others. You probably already notice this in yourself or others. Now is the time to take extra good care of yourself. This is hard.  **The media is your enemy**  The stream constant updates all across the media is driving you insane. It's a normal reaction to want more information during stress, to know what to do to keep safe. But in this case pretty much everything is outside of your control. Follow the measures from the governement, and that's it. All you need is 30 minutes a day from a reliable news source to stay up-to-date. Everything else will not inform you better, it will just drive you crazy. This subreddit is terrible, btw, with people posting a new corona-related article every 15 minutes. Other social media sites are just as bad. In fact, you would do well to avoid social media these days as much as possible.  **Find something to do**  You need to do something productive. Paint, draw, build somthing, learn a new language, play a videogame. Spring clean your entire place. Declutter. Wax your car. Clean your bike. Read a book.  **Relax**  Relaxation exercises work. Do them when you feel stressed. Breathing exercises, mindfullness, youtube-yoga.  [Breathing exercises in particular are very effective at calming yourself down in a matter of minutes.](https://www.healthline.com/health/4-7-8-breathing)  **Move your body**  You are allowed to go out every day to move. Walk, bike, run. Do this. Every day. Find someone to go with if you live alone. Keep your 1,5 m distance, but do it. You need to go out every day, and you need to move every day. Get the body up and running.  **Stay in touch**  Videocall your friends / family every day. Stay in touch. You need this. Especially if you live alone. Otherwise the loneliness will drive you insane.  **Things to remember**  * Follow the rules of the lockdown, help people when you can, and let the experts handle the rest. * Belgium has one of the best medical systems in the whole world. *(Remember to vote for parties who want to keep this system. Remember that a lot of right-wing parties have been trying for years to destroy our public healthcare system and turn it into a profit-machine like in the USA.)* * Our government is acting on the advice of reliable experts. * We are not being lied to. *(Marc Van Ranst himself said on television 2 weeks ago that he had underestimated this epidemic. The people in charge admit their mistakes. This is good. It means we can trust them.)* * We are not being left to fend for ourselves. We get unemployment money, we get healthcare. * We will get through this.\n",

      "I'm trying to look at the positive consequences cq. opportunities this crisis could have. Came up with a couple myself, would love to see more / have a discussion.     * remote work: I know companies who are now forcefully discovering the benefits of working from home, they would never implement it themselves and have all sorts of excuses. What if the government makes this a permanent thing: everyone who can has to work at least 1 or 2 days / week from home (maybe set a required amount of days for each month/year)? Imagine how this would reduce the strain on our roads, with a reduction in air pollution and possibly a reduction of the stress-levels (life/work balance) as health benefits. * digitization in general:  companies who still do business the old way with lots of paperwork are now all in a sudden forced to go (almost completely) digital and need to find solutions * digitization in education: my sister is a teacher, and from what I hear most of the teachers are only now starting to discover the massive possibilities/opportunities several of these learning platforms have. I can only speculate what the outcome would be here, but the fact that all teachers are now sort of required to look into it is a win in itself.  * electronic payments: I live in a small town, 25k people, ... and still can't pay by card at the doctor, dentist, small grocery store (to dodge taxes) and most of the pubs (not convenient). Until 1,5 year ago same story with my fysio. Until I explained that they could just install an app on their tablets so people can pay by phone, something they implemented overnight, same story with my favorite pub owner. Well guess this crisis gives the opportunity to the government to force every business to accept cards/e-payment.  * HoReCa: I'm a (silent) member of the Unie Belgische Horeca FB-group and saw numbers being mentioned the other day: Belgium allegedly has way more pubs per capita than the countries surrounding us. How hard this might be, if a number of those were to fail due to this crisis, it might strengthen the position of the ones that will survive. Or in other words: the natural selection now happens within a couple of months, whereas this would normally take up years. * Despite the fear for the virus and all the lives lost, I can imagine that this forced break from the ratrace might have some smaller positives: I noticed increased solidarity, people are re-learning what it is to be patient again, maybe we start to realize that we shouldn't take everything for granted, ...\n",

Normally all of our textbooks are supplied to us at a \"student friendly price\" through a bookshop on campus.   Recently the professor in question made it clear that we must purchase a tax law codex to pass his course, this codex costs about 155 euros! The reason it's so expensive is because we must buy the codex from the normal bookshop (there's no deal in place to provide it cheaper for students).    Because of the coronavirus i have no job atm + i have to pay for my kot which is empty atm, because yeah there's no university atm. I'm unable to afford a textbook of 155 euro's in short.   I had to request special permission to un enroll the course. The dean granted permission. However the professor got very mad, in fact so mad that he proceeded to make a mad tweet about me.   Am i going out of line here? I simply can't afford a codex of 155 euro's + he didn't add the codex as official \"studiemateriaal\" on the course information page so i was unable to know that i was gonna have to buy it beforehand.\n",

      "I'm interested in philosophy and ethics but never really studied it, however I am interested in what other people see/know/think about the specific topic of 'guidelines' for doctors in case the pandemic gets really bad and doctors have to choose who to save and who to let die.   First of all I want to say that it is not an unicum as I can imagine people working in war zones are making similar decisions on a daily basis and there the 'enemy' is another human being so I can imagine the psychology being a bit different than in these times.   Secondly, I'm not following all the news about all the different countries but it would be interesting to see how other countries deal with it as I believe the ethics are an important indicator of how a society thinks. For example more 'liberal' countries vs. more catholic/conservative ones or more capitalistic vs. more communistic etc. And to see if the differences in how they deal with this, is in line with one of the other divisions or if it's a completely 'new' dimension.   So as for Belgium, we were kind of 'lucky' that we had a bit more time to prepare and the ethical board of doctors made some rules about 'prioritisation' IN CASE we would be at maximum capacity and doctors have to choose who to 'give' a place on a breathing machine. I'll try to summarize them but here's a full article about it (in Dutch/French: [https://www.despecialist.eu/nl/nieuws/coronavirus-les-hopitaux-appeles-a-poser-des-choix.html](https://www.despecialist.eu/nl/nieuws/coronavirus-les-hopitaux-appeles-a-poser-des-choix.html) or dutch: [https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/03/19/ethische-richtlijn/](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/03/19/ethische-richtlijn/)).  \\- Focus should be on chance of survival ànd quality of survival  \\- No different treatment for Corona-patients or other patients  \\- In case of exactly the same medical 'state', younger people will be prioritised (but young people with 'worse' prognosis won't get the spot until they are in a similar state as the older person or something (not totally clear what they mean with this))  \\- First come, first served  \\- Should always be a group decision and not taken by 1 doctor only (objectifying by having the hospital's ethical commission evaluate it).   To me this all seemed quite logical and there is also no mentioning of people with underlying conditions or diseases so it seems they would get priority (in Belgium) if they're medical situation is worse.   &amp;#x200B;  In NL however, the debate took a very different direction (it seems) and some people are arguing for social darwinism claiming that it's natures way to reduce populations etc. (article in dutch) [https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/ik-wil-geen-publiek-debat-over-wanneer-jij-mij-mag-laten-doodgaan\\~bebfc97b/?utm\\_campaign=shared\\_earned&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_source=twitter](https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/ik-wil-geen-publiek-debat-over-wanneer-jij-mij-mag-laten-doodgaan~bebfc97b/?utm_campaign=shared_earned&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter).   I was quite shocked reading this but then I learned a bit more about the system in NL and in general they try to go more for a qualitative life-ending than trying to lenghten the age span considerably. So while in Belgium a lot of old people will use ICU units, in NL they receive palliative care and thus won't take up space in the hospitals. ([https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/03/27/medisch-ethica-erasmus-mc-we-moeten-wellicht-vaker-zeggen-we-behandelen-niet-a3995130](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/03/27/medisch-ethica-erasmus-mc-we-moeten-wellicht-vaker-zeggen-we-behandelen-niet-a3995130))   &amp;#x200B;  In a way I feel this might also be linked to the euthanasia 'debate' as it also implies questions about having a 'worthy' life-ending. Eg. would you prefer spending 3 weeks on an ICU unit not begin able to receive visitors and then die or spend 2 more weeks in your house where your relatives can visit (with of course social distancing measures and all still in place)?   At least I feel patients should have the option to not want to receive treatment but I don't know how this works in Belgium (or in other countries).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry if it's a bit chaotic but I just want to know other people's opinion about it, or if some 'philosophy' students can link my thoughts to some philosophical theories, go ahead :D So far I only got social darwinism out of it :p.   &amp;#x200B;  Tl; dr: doctors will face hard questions if capacity is full and they need to choose who to treat and how to 'decline' or 'let die';   \\- how do different countries deal with this?   \\-And what is your personal opinion about how doctors should decide?   \\-And last but not least, do patients have a chance to also state their preference or are they mostly ignored in the decision-making process?   Any philosophical theories about this, are very welcome :D   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks for my daily dose of philosophy or something \\^\\^\n",

      "I know there has been said a lot about Covid-19, its measures that are too soft or too hard, De Crem trying to install a police state, ect. I think it might be interesting to give my fellow Belgian redditors a perspective from 'our' side of the story. I'll try to keep my personal opinion aside as much as possible, and give an objective image about how things are going.  First of all: it have been really crazy days for police services since the measures started. Shifts look completly different, doing border control, patrol to see if all people keep social distancing, ect. My working scheme is a complete mess and we hardly know which shift we'll have to work the next day.   So, as said, things are almost completly different now. We see quite a lot good effects like less car accidents, less burgarly (as almost everyone is home), no thefts (as all shops are closed). The 'criminal' aspect of the job is almost completly gone.   It all shifts into the direction of maintaining public order. I must admit, as I work in quite a rural department, most people keep the measures in mind. But what is really remarkable is how big social control is. Our shifts are filled with this kind of calls:  * \"My neighboor has visit\" * \"I'm walking on the street and see light in this pub\" * \"I just passed by a \"frietkot\" and there were 3 people waiting in there whilst the place is way too small\" * \"I'm in the park and 3 children are playing ball games here\" * \"People are eating ice cream and sitting on the bench on the town square\"  As already said, I'm not going into opinions on these situations or whatsoever but for police, it is really difficult to be on time to make the right observations. There is really an overload of similar calls and shifts are filled with driving from the ice cream eaters to the parksitters, back to the too packed \"frietkot\".  Also, there still is a lot of confusion about the interpretation about some measures, even for the police. There is the MB (Ministrieel Besluit) which states what can and what not. But the crisis center of the Belgian Government also made a sort of \"guide\" or \"FAQ\" for police with some additional information about the measures. Wouldn't it be Belgian if there are contradictions between those documents?  You sometimes can't imagine how complex situations can become due to the measures. For example: a French farmer has an small car accident whilst being on the road with a bull to go impregnate a cow of a Belgian farmer. You see my point?  We understand the measures will get a \"light version\" within a few weeks but things will get more complex for police to make the right observations. For example: the fact that parents can now make a car trip with young children (&gt;5 years)for recreational purposes is one the newest measures. I'm happy for those families but for police, this a difficult situation. Let's say we do a traffic control on a car with a family. Mother and father in the front. On the backseat a kid that looks 6-7 years old. Kids at that age don't need an ID-card so we'll need to contact our transmission center, run one of the parents through an ID check to conclude the kid is (not) old enough for this trip.   Another thing is the border control. To put it short: this is pure deception to the people. We have a border with France. Due to shortage on personnel, the border crossings are only controlled on daytime. At night, the border is almost completly open for anyone. For French citizens to cross the border, they need a document with information about e.g. their Belgian employer or invitation. Though, these documents are free to find online and are filled in handwritten and need 2 signatures (one of the employee and one of the employer). Who the hell knows if those signatures are correct? It is just one big shit show that takes up a lot of capacity of police services and has almost none or zero added value to the situation.  There's only one thing I want to give my opinion about: De Crem using the crisis trying to install a police state. Tbh I laughed really hard when I saw this was one of the headlines in the media. First of all: De Crem has almost no idea what he's talking about. A few days back, he even said in a TV interview that \"politie en rijkswacht hun uiterste best doen.\" (translated: police and gendarmie are doing their best). Small note: the gendarmerie is disbanded almost 20 years ago. So yeah, this guy has evil plans to install a police state... /s.  Imo the reason the \"kliklijnen\"were introduced is because the police dispatchings are overloaded with calls like I mentioned above. So, in fact, this is a phenomen created by the community itself.  The drones thing on the other hand, is probably the idea of an opportunistic chief somewhere on the higher levels of police or something that has been asked by a local mayor or governer.   So, I hope some of you have better idea now about how things are going on 'our' side. Anything else you are wondering? AMA except opinions on certain matters.   Thanks for reading and y'all stay safe!\n",

March 13: Lockdown is enforced and working from home advised.  His office understandably wants to keep working during Corona times. However, they don't provide any safety measures except 'our building is big enough to spread out and keep 1,5m apart'. Husband gets scared because 1) he is seriously immuno compromised and 2) his office is the central point of the building: small but also provided with the printing machine, coffee machine, water tap,..... It's also the place where every patiënt passes through on their way to their appointment. Mostly foreign roots of which 75% hardly speak Dutch, French or English.  Everybody constantly passes through this tiny space and very close to him. 3) he commutes to work by public transport. Cramped spaces and sick people don't match well in Corona times.   So husband consults his specialist in UZ Brussel and he strongly advises to stay home.  Informs hiss boss of this in person and also tells him why. Very big step for him, because he told no one except our closest relatives.  Boss has no reaction of empathy whatsoever, but questions the necessity because ' they can sit 1,5m apart'. Working from home is perfectly possible for my husband and most colleagues with a little bit of digital effort (he has numerous tasks he can work on for weeks, can make appointments from home, pay bills etc. He even had Zoom set up for all the colleagues which they now use daily for meetings. Several colleagues have started doing online meetings with patients since they've seen the advantages and also prefer not to go the office frequently.)  Boss however is not happy. Doesn't outright say husband should come in but states 'that his colleagues question his loyalty to the work place'. And 'I strongly believe some of us are totally overreacting'.  He is also moaning about  'these online meetings and appointments that were initiated without his approval'. At one point wants to stop using Zoom and move to MS Teams. Then stops this because Teams is too difficult ( he's a digital nitwit). Then wants to try another platform that he has my husband working on, trying out and installing for 4 days, then is silent to every mail or phone call for 3 days and then states that he decided not to use this anyway right after giving this assignment to my husband but forgot to mention this earlier.  He acts as a kid who didn't get his way and is now sulking.  Plus telling someone you have HIV is a huge step, a simple ' I'm sorry you have this' would have been more empathic then questioning if you're really immuno compromised enough to stay home.  I would have expected more from a psychiologist....!   RANT OVER!\n",

I'm writing my thesis about Ex-Hasidic Jews and initially had plans to move back to my hometown of NYC to write it but the pandemic changed all those plans and as such I've decided to stay in Brussels for the foreseeable future. As such, I'm wondering if anyone has any insight into resources that may (or may not) be available for people who wish to leave the Hasidic Jewish sect in Antwerp. In NYC there is an organization called \"Footsteps\" that is basically THE place to contact if you are considering leaving. I'm wondering if there is an equivalent in Antwerp? Since this topic has become ever increasingly popular I have to assume that there exists at least ONE resource in the city of Antwerp due to the population of Hasidim. If anyone has any insights please list them here. I googled and was not able to find anything concrete at all.\n",

      "Hey. I literally haven't left the house since December (for surgery). My brother did some shopping early February, the rest of our supplies are deliveries to our home. We haven't had to leave the house during all of this. Turns out, you can't order tobacco online. It's forbidden by law. What's the safest way to buy tobacco, then? There's either a nightshop, few customers, unsure about their standards relating to covid. A press shop, with significantly more people going in and out, possibly better standards. Or a supermarket, higher standards, disinfected shopping carts etc, but in the same closed space with many other people at once. I feel so lost. I've been stretching my reserves, went from being a chimney to 5 per day just to get my nicotine hit somewhat reliably. But I don't see this thing ending anytime soon, and probably getting worse the longer I wait. So I'll definitely have to go out and get supply for a few months.   What would you recommend? Personally I'm leaning towards night shop. Least contact with people. Put everything in a bag. Disinfect bag and products once I'm back inside. Strip near the door, leave clothes there for a week or two before taking them inside the living area, shower and then settle back into my inside routine?   I feel like shit for having to go out for tobacco, but I'm literally freaking out over it. My depression started setting back in a few weeks ago, but I don't want to risk seeing a doctor either. I'll go bonkers if I have no more tobacco.   Is there any other option I'm not aware off that prevents having to go outside? I don't want to leave the house. But I see no other option... I'm really lost right now. Potatoes, meat, everything you can get delivered. But tobacco? Apparently not.\n",

      "Hello, I study Business Management in Mechelen and need to interview a manager for a course. Since corona, it has become very hard to contact people. I had an interview lined up and contacted numerous people but nobody responds to my mails anymore.  Therefore I turn to you, the users of /r/belgium   The criteria for the interviewee are as followed:  * 10 years of experience (at any job) * 5 years of experience in a management function * At least 5 employees (subordinates)  But if you are a few years off in terms of experience, I don't mind. I'm not really picky.  The topic of this interview is the management cycle (Plan, Act, Monitor, Review) and how you implement and use this. I will send you a full list of questions (8-12 questions) in front.   We can conduct this interview by mail or (video)call. Preferred languages are Dutch or English. I guess this woudn't take more than 15 minutes of your time.    So if you by happenstance turn out to fit the criteria and are happy to help a Belgian student, you can PM, post a comment or send a mail mgmtinterview@gmail.com  If you are wary of sending a mail to a random mail address, just send me a mail saying you're interested so I can respond with my academic mail to work out the details. I will need your real name and name of the company you work for, but I will contact you with my academic mail in case you sent me on the gmail address. That way, you don't have to use your reddit username in case that is sensitive to you.   I know these posts can be spammy on the subreddit, that's why I refrained from doing so but like I said, it has become hard to contact people in other ways.\n",

      "Once the Corona lock-down ends, I might start looking for a new job in Belgium, assuming that the labor market will not be in shambles. My current job title is *data scientist*. I will be looking for a similar position as the one I have now, but with a different employer. I want to use this opportunity to increase my compensation, which I believe is currently below my value (more on that below). Hence, I was hoping that the hive mind would help me with approximating my market value. There is public information available on sites such as Glassdoor and Payscale, but the  spread is very wide and usually lacks context (candidate skill level, experience, etc..).  I would like to come to a realistic range that I can use as a baseline when negotiating my compensation. Below I provide some information about my profile.  ## Profile  ### Education &amp; experience  -   PhD in a quantitative discipline -   2-3 years of industry experience -   R&amp;D project management -   AI strategy consulting -   Machine learning     -   Multivariate time series forecasting     -   Computer vision     -   Unsupervised learning &amp; clustering -   Data engineering     -   Data store management         -   GCP cloud storage         -   MySQL         -   Postgres         -   MongoDB         -   BigQuery     -   Building ETL pipelines     -   Workflow scheduling &amp; orchestration -   Data science &amp; analytics     -   Translating data insights to non-technical audiences     -   Building interactive dashboards (animations, geo maps, etc..)     -   Building &amp; scheduling BI reports (Data Studio)     -   Monte Carlo simulations -   DevOps     -   App development (with Python)         -   Web         -   CLI         -   REST API     -   Microservice architecture (Docker &amp; Docker-compose)     -   Version control with GitFlow branching model     -   Testing (unit, property, integration) &amp; debugging     -   Continuous integration with Bitbucket pipelines     -   Deployment with GCP Compute &amp; App engines     -   Documentation (MkDocs)  ### Skills, knowledge &amp; the rest  -   Machine learning stack     -   Tensorflow (Keras)     -   Pytorch     -   Scikit-learn     -   XGBoost     -   PyMC3     -   Pandas     -   NumPy     -   MLflow -   Python -   Jupyter -   SQL -   R -   Bash -   Docker -   Selenium (beginner) -   Git -   Spark (beginner with PySpark &amp; Koalas) -   Bayesian inference &amp; econometrics -   I work well in a team and I am easy to work with, or so I hear.  ## Current situation  In a nutshell, in my own perception I am a mixture of a data scientist, a data engineer &amp; a Python developer. Currently I work at a tech startup, where I am executing all kinds of tasks, as is typical of a startup employment. This has been very rewarding, but I increasingly find that a majority of my time is being spent on managerial tasks and given how the company is situated, I do not see that changing any time soon. Therefore I would like to transfer to a bigger employer with mature data operations in place, where I can focus more on what I want to do - data science/engineering &amp; development. At the same time, I strongly suspect that given my skill set and experience I am underpaid relative to my comparable peers, so I would like to get that fixed when transferring to a new employer.  My current compensation consists of:  -   €3500 bruto salary -   maaltijdcheques -   phone subscription -   group insurance -   laptop  ## Requested input  Given this background, what kind of compensation package should I be aiming for? I am not settled on any particular industry yet (but flirting with tech research institutes &amp; fintech) and considering that industry context can significantly influence the level of compensation, please include this information as well if you judge relevant for this type of work.  Many thanks in advance to those willing to chime in!\n",
