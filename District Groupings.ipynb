I was furloughed, and have been collecting unemployment since then. (also don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s relevant, but I found out today my boss did receive the PPP loan, but I will admit I am ignorant to what that means exactly - but I know that my paychecks are coming from unemployment and NOT from my boss or my office.) on April 29, the *federal* CDC still said NO elective procedures (including cleanings) at this time, but the *state* of AL is overriding this recommendation and saying dental offices may resume elective procedures. the ADA (american dental association) also says no elective procedures at this time. I am not willing to risk my health or my husbands health just to clean someones teeth. dental cleanings are important, but NOT essential at this time, which is why the CDC and ADA are still saying no. I want to leave my job, because it truly is unsafe. not only have we been given less than adequate \\u201crequirements\\u201d for PPE (meaning we should be required to have more PPE during treatment), we don\\u2019t even HAVE the PPE! my boss claims we will have it by when we open on Monday, but the receipts from the orders say May 13th at the earliest. there\\u2019s no way he will have the PPE for us that is required. also, my job has been given a covid-risk-score of 99.7 out of 100, and performing cleanings at this time is so not essential or worth that risk. my boss said if I quit I can\\u2019t file unemployment and that I should \\u201cstrongly reconsider\\u201d before leaving. basically he is panicking because several of us are quitting/wanting to quit. I feel that my reasoning for refusing work would qualify as \\u201cgood work cause\\u201d but I really don\\u2019t know and am appreciate of any guidance that can be offered. thank you!! edited to add: per [this page at justia.com]LINK under section (5) *FAILURE TO ACCEPT AVAILABLE SUITABLE WORK, ETC.* article (a) it states: I feel that going to work under conditions against the CDCs recommendations and without proper PPE will qualify as \\u201crisk involved to my health, safety, and morals\\u201d but I am not sure. second edit: I also work at a pediatric-only office. so not only are pediatric cleanings *really* not vital right now, but children are known to often be symptomatic carriers of covid.\", \"title\": \"[Unemployment] trying to see if I have \\u201cgood work related cause\\u201d to collect unemployment.\"} \n",

I see the same questions over and over again so I'm typing this up in hopes it will help some people. I've done so much research into this and CARES act so here's what I know from the bill, department of labor and AL department of labor. Regular unemployment: This is the state paid unemployment insurance. It looks at the last 5 quarters of your work history (January 2019-March 2020) but only the first 4 quarters will be used to calculate how much you are eligible to receive. EVERYONE who has been affected by COVID-19 will have to file regular unemployment first and certify every week. They will contact your employer to verify eligibility and separation reasons. Must certify weekly. FPUC: This is part of CARES act and it is the $600 additional unemployment insurance. You are qualified to receive this if you are paid at least $1 through unemployment, PUC or PEUC. This payment is eligible for retro pay starting week ending 4/4/20 and eligible to pay until week ending 7/25/20. PUA: This is part of CARES act and what a lot of people are waiting for. This is a special provision to pay unemployment to anyone who does not normally qualify to receive state unemployment. This is federally funded. AL dept of labor has just started sending out letters to anyone who was not approved for state unemployment including but not limited to self employed people, lack of work history and $0 monetary eligibility, contractors, non-profit employees, etc. Fill out the letter and email/fax/mail it back with required documentations. There is currently no estimated timeline on how soon this will be processed. Federal guideline states the amount of PUA benefits you will receive is based on your previous income reported. PUA benefits may not be more than the state's maximum weekly benefit rate for regular UC, which is $275 in Alabama. PUA benefits may not be less than half of the state's average weekly benefit amount. I'm unaware of this amount for Alabama. PUA is good for 39 weeks until 12/25/20 and eligible for retro pay beginning 1/27/20. Eligible to receive the $600 FPUC. Must certify weekly. PEUC: This is part of CARES act and also federally funded. It is for people who have exhausted their state benefits after 7/1/19 and not eligible for unemployment. You must be able to and seeking work except in instances where COVID-19 made it impossible including being sick or quarantined or shelter-in-place is in order. Also eligible to receive the $600 FPUC. I did not look up how much PEUC pays. Must certify weekly.

Here is the latest from the Utility Board: As we all continue to deal with the changes forced on us with the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), Opp Utilities will extend the suspension of disconnects for non-payment through April 30th, 2020. Late fees and extension fees will also be waived during the month of April. Opp Utilities reminds customers that payment for your utility services are still due by the due date and Opp Utilities encourages all who are not financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to pay their bills on time. This will help avoid larger bills being due on your May 2020 Utility bill that could potentially include two or more months of service. Our lobby is closed but our drive thru can be used to pay your bill, connect, disconnect, or transfer your services. We also encourage you to utilize our Online Bill Pay at WWW.cityofopp.com It\\u2019s a free service and it allows you to pay your bill from home. If you need help signing up, please call us.

With all the talk of states and countries taking various measures to contain the spread of this disease, I\\u2019m curious about y\\u2019alls opinions on locking down the state. Or locking down cities or municipalities or what have you. Kay Ivey (and Tate Reeves, Mississippi\\u2019s governor\\u2014I\\u2019ve been a resident of both states) has taken flak for not issuing lockdowns or shelter in place orders, and I\\u2019m wondering why. Obviously the case can be made that social distancing is a valuable tactic for preventing (or at least mitigating) the spread of the virus. Nobody knows how many people will eventually become sick, and the issue is more about flattening the curve, rather than dictating its eventual objective height, so to speak. So in all honesty, staying home and limiting contact with people is generally a great idea for the largest amount of people, since there are only so many beds and ventilators and manpowers. But how do we balance that with people\\u2019s freedom in this country? A lot of people want to see state-level crackdowns on movement and assembly, and I can see why, but I\\u2019m concerned that we haven\\u2019t thought through what that could mean for all of us, long term. What amount of power do we want to give the government in order to keep people from going places and doing things? How long do we want the government to enforce those powers? When, if ever, will we ask the government to give up that power, and can we expect the government to comply with our wishes? Do we prevent people from going to church? That\\u2019s a big sticky first amendment lawsuit waiting to happen, and I\\u2019m betting politicians don\\u2019t want to see that. Do we keep people in their homes under force of law? How long before that turns into the police using deadly force to ensure compliance? Does it ever get that far? I think smart people will stay home. I think they\\u2019ll wash their hands and avoid unnecessary contact with people. I think they\\u2019ll avoid touching their faces. If they try hard enough, I think anyone could avoid catching the disease, given they didn\\u2019t catch it before they knew how to avoid it.

Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources.

It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit. #**CONTEXT:** A recent in-depth [study]LINK has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed]LINK and the virus has only been halted through stringent social distancing measures. In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said]LINK this is not a drill. **The bad news:** There are currently over [190,000]LINK global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it]LINK as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community. **The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism. And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation]LINK The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running. So go ahead and meet [your foe]LINK Do not underestimate it. Now prepare to go to war. #**IMPORTANT:** * **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. \\\"Cough dispersion\\\" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft \\\"coughing distance\\\" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the \\\"Risk Reduction\\\" section below). **[Here's]LINK an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here]LINK * **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE]LINK IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **\\\"The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.\\\"** [Source.]LINK (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation]LINK Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials]LINK speak for themselves. * **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article]LINK | [Study]LINK * **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link]LINK with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says \\\"you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that.\\\" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms.

If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community. * If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones. * Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online. * Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose. * Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source]LINK * Use a humidifier.

As a result of this, I feel that basing policies and decisions on only the information that has been made available through government sponsored sources is brash and will result in delayed response that could potentially have severe impacts on the health and general well being of Tuscaloosa's residents. Due to the lack of information and at times, point-blank disinformation, I have taken it upon myself to find and verify information that should be available to the public and those, like yourselves, making choices that will impact the lives of thousands to millions. During my research I have found a number of risk factors that are being neglected by these government sponsored sources and, if they were taken into account, could substantially lower the threshold required to take significant preventative action. 1) There are not enough test kits to properly track the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 2) The government has continuously downplayed the severity of the outbreak, purposefully skewed statistics, and deliberately spread their apathetic outlook. 3) SARS-CoV-2 can lay dormant in the host for up to 14 days and they become a viable transmission vector even before minor symptoms become apparent. 4) SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted at distances significantly larger than the accepted safe distance, can remain in the air for 30 minutes, and can survive on surfaces for days. 5) The previous strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) left survivors with life long health complications. 6) Findings from a paper published in 2007 \\\"demonstrate a strong association between early, sustained, and layered application of nonpharmaceutical interventions and mitigating the consequences of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States.\\\" 7) \\\"so far only one measure has been effective against the coronavirus: extreme social distancing.\\\" There are no 'confirmed' cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Alabama, but in no way does that mean that the virus is not here. Dr. Matt McCarthy, author of Superbugs and Infectious disease physician said on CNBC: \\\"I still do not have a rapid diagnostic test available... The CDC created a test, sent the test out to 50 states and then said, 'oop, hold up, don't use it. Let us fix it.' its now March... I still have to call the department of health, make my case, plead to test people. This is not good.\\\" (1a[1:00-1:34]) \\\"The person who tested positive was only the 32nd test we've done in this state. That is a national scandal. They are testing 10,000 a day in some countries and we can't get this off the ground... I don't have the tools to properly care for patients today.\\\" (1a[2:04-2:20]) The lack of testing is one of the most important risk factors because without proper testing there is no way to really know the full extent of SARS-CoV-2's spread. The numbers we're seeing today are likely a fraction of the total cases, and there's no way to tell if the virus has spread to states beyond what is being reported by government sponsored sources, because \\\"the low case count is likely due to how few people have been tested.\\\" (1b) Q: \\\"It's got an incubation period of potentially a couple of weeks, so are we just always gonna be behind the 8 ball on this, where we're reacting to the news two weeks later.\\\" A: \\\"Well we have a lot of diagnosed cases, to his point right now, there are probably low thousands of cases in this country that we need to turn over the card on, so were gonna have a surge in cases before we start to catch up to the actual level of spread\\\" (1a[5:57-6:17]) \\\"A week or two from now is when we are going to begin getting real information, right now, were still largely flying blind\\\" (1a[8:11-8:18]) Another important risk factor and likely the most dangerous is that the government is actively spreading misinformation about the level of risk that SARS-CoV-2 presents to The United States. In a recent statement made by Donald Trump, he said that: \\\"We made a good move. We closed it down. We stopped it. Otherwise, the head of the CDC said last night that you would've had thousand of more problems if we didn't shut it down very early. that was a very early shut down\\\" (2a) To which, a CNN fact check reporter responded: \\\"Well we clearly didn't stop it. Ya know, this virus is spreading in the United States.\\\" (2a) This sort of misinformation is going to cause massive harm to the general population and similar statements and actions are continuing to this day. One such action that transpired yesterday was that the Trump administration postponed the release of an important intelligence report warning that the United States remains unprepared for a global pandemic. \\\"Rather than acting on these recurrent warnings and bolstering America\\u2019s ability to respond to an outbreak, the Trump administration has instead cut back money and personnel from pandemic preparedness. In May 2018, Trump\\u2019s aides dismissed the National Security Council\\u2019s global health security staff and moved to cut its budget. The White House also cut the budgets of the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services, and closed the federal government\\u2019s $30 million Complex Crises Fund.\\\" (2b) \\\"The message today that we are hearing from this administration that 'the risk is low' and that 'things are probably going to be okay. You don't need to change your lifestyle.' That's simply not true. There are going to be thousands of cases here. We have already moved from containment to mitigation. We are trying to lessen the severity here. You are going to see widespread disruption to daily life. Do not believe the false reassurance.\\\" (1a[3:04-3:27]) The rampant misinformation, combined with SARS-CoV-2's ability to lay dormant for up to 14 days (3) has created an extremely high risk environment where carriers that are unaware they have contracted the virus continue to go about their lives with a false sense of security while they have the potential to unknowingly infect anyone that happens to get too close or touch something the carrier had touched within the last few days. These are risk factors 3 and 4. \\\"The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 can linger in the air for at least 30 minutes and travel up to 4.5 metres \\u2013 further than the \\u201csafe distance\\u201d advised by health authorities around the world, according to a study by a team of Chinese government epidemiologists. The researchers also found that it can last for days on a surface where respiratory droplets land, raising the risk of transmission if unsuspecting people touch it and then rub their face. The length of time it lasts on the surface depends on factors such as temperature and the type of surface, for example at around 37C (98F), it can survive for two to three days on glass, fabric, metal, plastic or paper.\\\" (4) Make sure to view the bus diagram from source 4 SARS-CoV-2's ability to travel greater distances and survive longer away from a host than initially hypothesized is likely playing a large part in the rapid rate of transmission, but transmission is only one side of the coin. The other side is risk factor 5: It is also possible, if not likely, that SARS-CoV-2 will carry with it, life long health complications in addition to the the initial effects on the respiratory system like the SARS virus in 2003. \\\"Patients who were infected but came through the epidemic are learning that severe acute respiratory syndrome can leave lingering physical and psychological effects, which not only don\\u2019t resolve over time but can actually get worse. SARS, initially considered a severely acute illness that would resolve like other pneumonias, has turned out to be a chronic disease with symptoms that researchers speculate could persist for life.\\\" (5) Considering the lack of test kits, rampant misinformation, 2 week dormancy, greater than hypothesized transmission ability, and the possibility of life long health complications, SARS-CoV-2 is not something to be taken lightly. With so many unknowns, it would be a brash decision to be reactive rather than proactive. This is not the first time we've faced a problem like this and studies have shown that, in the past, proactive measures can significantly lessen the impact of such a threat. One such study on the influenza pandemic in 1918-1919 showed that: \\\"The cities that implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality (Spearman r = \\u22120.74, P &lt; .001), lower peak mortality rates (Spearman r = 0.31, P = .02), and lower total mortality (Spearman r = 0.37, P = .008). There was a statistically significant association between increased duration of nonpharmaceutical interventions and a reduced total mortality burden (Spearman r = \\u22120.39, P = .005).\\\" (6) \\\"These findings demonstrate a strong association between early, sustained, and layered application of nonpharmaceutical interventions and mitigating the consequences of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States. In planning for future severe influenza pandemics, nonpharmaceutical interventions should be considered for inclusion as companion measures to developing effective vaccines and medications for prophylaxis and treatment.\\\" (6) \\\"Most pandemic influenza policy makers agree that even the most rigorous nonpharmaceutical interventions are unlikely either to prevent a pandemic or change a population's underlying biological susceptibility to the pandemic virus. However, a growing body of theoretical modeling research suggests that nonpharmaceutical interventions might play a salubrious role in delaying the temporal effect of a pandemic; reducing the overall and peak attack rate; and reducing the number of cumulative deaths.11-15 Such measures could potentially provide valuable time for production and distribution of pandemic-strain vaccine and antiviral medication. Optimally, appropriate implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions would decrease the burden on health care services and critical infrastructure.\\\" (6) Risk factors 6 is that those in charge of policy concerning the spread of SARS-CoV-2 can worsen the impact of the virus by neglecting to act fast enough. This is made even more problematic given the rampant misinformation concerning the virus which makes it increasingly more likely that those in charge of policy will act reactivity instead of proactively and unintentionally contribute to the infection, death, and possible long term health concerns of a large portion of those they are supposed to protect. When the influenza epidemic of 1918 infected a quarter of the U.S. population, killing tens of millions of people, seemingly small choices made the difference between life and death. (7) As the disease was spreading, Wilmer Krusen, Philadelphia\\u2019s health commissioner, allowed a huge parade to take place on September 28th; some 200,000 people marched. In the following days and weeks, the bodies piled up in the city\\u2019s morgues. By the end of the season, 12,000 residents had died. (7) In St. Louis, a public health commissioner named Max Starkloff decided to shut the city down. Ignoring the objections of influential businessmen, he closed the city\\u2019s schools, bars, cinemas, and sporting events. Thanks to his bold and unpopular actions, the per capita fatality rate in St. Louis was half that of Philadelphia. (In total roughly 1,700 people died from influenza in St Louis.) (7) In the coming days, thousands of people across the country will face the choice between becoming a Wilmer Krusen or a Max Starkloff. (7) In the moment, it will seem easier to follow Krusen\\u2019s example. For a few days, while none of your peers are taking the same steps, moving classes online or canceling campaign events will seem profoundly odd. People are going to get angry. You will be ridiculed as an extremist or an alarmist. But it is still the right thing to do. (7) What side of history do you want to be on? If the virus really has been 'closed down' it's an over reaction and there are substantial and unnecessary economic and social impacts, but in the far more likely event that SARS-CoV-2 is as dangerous as it appears then you could be responsible for making it more likely that the impact on health care services and critical infrastructure is minimal, reducing the overall and peak attack rate, and saving the lives of and reducing the damage inflicted on the people you're meant to protect.

Since you seem to be confused on this point, let me try to explain it simply: Social distancing is meant to help prevent spreading the virus to other people. That is all. The more distance there is between you and an infected person, the less chance there is of catching the virus from them. Six feet was suggested as a \\\"doable\\\" distance for people who had to be near other people, like while shopping. When you sneeze or cough, you eject moisture droplets of different sizes. If you are shedding the virus, those droplets contain it. Larger droplets contain more virus, but those droplets are heavy and fall out of the air quickly. If you are a few feet away, there is a good chance that those large, virus-laden particles will fall onto a surface before they reach you.

      "{\"author\": \"cannons_for_days\", \"body\": \"OK. So, we can do three things to respond to this disease: 1. We can do nothing. People will get sick and die, but them's the breaks. This is the strategy where 60% of the population contracts the disease before herd immunity starts to kick in. Given even the most optimistic estimates of fatality rates of this disease, this results in about a million people dying. Maybe more if we're wrong about asymptomatic transmission rates or how serious COVID-19 is for people who develop symptoms. I think everyone agrees this is a bad choice, and is generally not how we should handle this. 2. We can socially isolate. This isn't great because humans are social creatures and we don't like being cooped up, but *if we do it perfectly*, it causes the virus to burn out, at which point keeping it out of the population is simply a matter of making sure people who have it don't travel. This is what we've been doing for two months in the hopes that we can ramp up all the supplies we need for option #3... 3. Proper precautions (wearing masks and enforcing hygiene), testing, and contact tracing. Effective execution of this approach keeps the disease pretty well-contained without the radical disruption of normal activities that lockdown does. (See: South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, all of whom have been seriously testing from day one and are well past their peaks.) Economists all agree that this approach is the best, but the US still doesn't have enough tests to make this work, despite having had two months to ramp all that up. States and governors don't have the ability to force companies to make more tests. The Federal government does. So this plan requires coordination on the national level, which so far we haven't really seen the current administration take decisive action on. Health care professionals and economists agree that we *don't* want 60% of the population to get sick. States and localities don't have the ability to make testing and contact tracing work without help, so they've been doing the only thing they can in the meantime - make people socially isolate. The *hope* was that the Federal government would use that time to get testing lined up and train people to do contact tracing, or at least create a *plan* for those things to happen. If the Federal government is doing that, it's done a poor job communicating that to the States. So now the States are stuck either asking their citizens to shelter in place *indefinitely* or just turning everyone loose and risking millions of deaths. I think we can all agree that both of those are bad. If the Federal government gets off its ass and finally comes up with a plan for testing and tracing, then the States could probably draw up plans to get back to (mostly) normal without endangering people, even if they had to do things in phases. But we're not seeing leadership on this from the only people who can do anything about it, so for now we're stuck in this Catch-22. So, what's the difference? The difference is that if we keep socially isolating and people *actually stick to that*, you won't get sick in October. If you don't have faith that people will keep isolating, then you make that call for yourself. Me?

I\\u2019m concerned about a few trends I saw so I\\u2019ll break that down and say where those slippery slope can lead to. Mainly it was the incredible fear mongering by the media. It\\u2019s absolutely shameful how much they have tried to profiteer off this crisis and the side effect is that real people are terrified beyond what is logical for their situation. It\\u2019s one thing to lay out the facts but the media is hyperbolic and runs the death and infection rates like a scoreboard. Just then on cnn. If we had a media like this in WW2 I don\\u2019t know if we would have won. It\\u2019s so demoralizing what they\\u2019re doing and the panic creates social stress which has bad outcomes. When people are scared they don\\u2019t make good decisions. They might give up rights to alleviate their fear even if it does not help. In this case many people were willing to lose their right to travel, freedom of association, or their ability to go to work. I can\\u2019t remember if it was Michigan or NY which said they couldn\\u2019t provide speedy trials due to the virus. So much for the bill of rights I guess. You can\\u2019t have freedom or civil liberties in a climate of fear and I\\u2019m deeply concerned that this crisis will erode our civil liberties by enshrining these power grabs into law. Spoiler alert for the 2005 movie V for Vendetta but the plot involves a politician gaining power after a virus brings England to a state of panic after nearly 100k deaths... So England elected a strong man who promptly brought a fascist government into power. It\\u2019s fiction, but you see it\\u2019s not a new idea. I\\u2019m also concerned about the tyrannical power to declare business or industries \\u201cnon essential\\u201d. I worked at a movie theater as an usher in college. The money I earned was essential to me so I got up and got to work. So I resent the non-essential label and see the actions of banning or restricting certain industries as tyrannical. Nobody elected Kay Ivey thinking she would have the right to shut down my local movie theater and barber shop whenever she wanted as long as it was. \\u201cAn emergency\\u201d. Even if it is an emergency, this such a huge decision in my life that I would would want to make the decision myself on whether to work or not. I totally understand anyone being bitter over losing their job due to a political order beyond their control and with no recourse. Looking at the big picture we don\\u2019t know a lot of things about this virus. How can we pretend to know enough to intervene in people\\u2019s lives over it?

The [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)]LINK was specifically organized to track all available information and make projections. This is the primary model being used by the White House to make decisions. While I don't agree with their projections - they are obviously wrong in many cases - still, this is what is being used. [Here]LINK are the projections for Alabama. Please note that this statement under Containment Strategies: \\\"**After May 21, 2020, relaxing social distancing may be possible with containment strategies that include testing, contact tracing, isolation, and limiting gathering size.**\\\" They also predict that, if we follow their guidance, we will only have 294 Covid-19 deaths by August 4th. Since we are currently sitting at 279 on May 1st, and we are about to start reopening, I believe it is safe to say that this projection is going to be wildly wrong. Does that help to answer your question(s)? Sorry, I forgot that COVID19 has been discovered by the Average Joe with an agenda that posts a lot of crap. It's pretty safe to listen to the debate among any flaired users, as their credentials have been verified. It's also not too hard to tell which people have some idea of what they are talking about and which ones don't. One of the best metrics to use is that most qualified commenters examine the data and comment on that, and it's accuracy and interpretation, and cite other studies as references when questioning things. I have just enough education to read the papers posted and understand a good bit of most of them, as well as knowing what to google in order to understand better. It also helps me to weed out the commenters who don't know what they are talking about, and to evaluate some of the statements made by the knowledgeable ones. (Except for statistics. I'm lost when it comes to statistics.) To give you an example of one ongoing controversy: Sweden. Sweden decided not to do a lockdown. Then, they decided to do a modified lockdown. They are protecting their high-risk group, and their hospitals are not overwhelmed (yet, anyway). They have chosen to let the virus burn through the population until herd immunity is reached.

      "{\"author\": \"coosacat\", \"body\": \"The first thing you are forgetting is that most Walmarts are primarily grocery stores, which are an essential business, and where many poor people get their groceries. They are often the only affordable option for low-income individuals. They are also a pharmacy, filling thousands of prescriptions weekly for customers. Walmart is not at \\\"full capacity\\\". They are - by corporate policy, not state or federal - limited to 20% of their capacity. Those people standing out front with iPads or TC70s are counting people as they come in. The store hours are slashed, sometimes to a third of normal operating hours. The grocery carts are sprayed down with disinfectant before being made available to customers. Walmart is open only a fraction of their normal operating hours. Only one exit/entrance is open. The Auto Care Center is closed. The Vision Center is open only for minor repairs and supplies. The hair/nail salons and the in-store restaurants are shut down. The fitting rooms are closed. The jewelry counter is not doing ear piercings. The Garden Center is partly shut down. The return desk is mostly shut down. Some stores are enforcing one-way aisles throughout the store. In some states, sales of items considered non-essential are prohibited. Unless that state gives them legal authority to do so, customers cannot be screened. That is not Walmart policy - if you think that should have been, or should be done now, you need to contact your state leadership about that matter. Employees *are* health-screened before being allowed to clock in, and face masks are mandated for all employees while at work. Employees who fail the health screen are sent home on paid quarantine for at least 7 days, and require a doctor's permission to return. Employees can't even exit out the same way they came in, because we could have been infected while on shift, and pass it on to entering employees. All meetings are held outside, or in a large open space within the store, so employees are able to stay 6 feet apart. Etc., etc. You have no idea the precautions that are being taken, and the time and money being spent to mitigate the effects of remaining open. If the state mandated that all re-opening businesses had to follow the same procedures, most of them would choose to remain closed. I *wish* the state would require that customers be screened, and that they wear masks and gloves. Twenty-three Walmart employees have died of Covid-19 that I know of, and there are probably more. Your comment seems to be based solely on your perceived inconvenience, rather than the risk that is being run by the employees in those stores. At least Walmart provides paid leave for anyone who is confirmed positive and/or mandated into quarantine by either Walmart, the doctor, or the government. How many of the businesses that are reopening are going to do that for their employees? All of these low-income employees are going to be shit on *again*, because they are going to be forced to come back to work before we have any kind of effective testing/contract tracing system in place, and no compensation if they get sick. They will come back to work and work while sick, spread the disease, and then, if they get sick enough, be not only out of work and not earning any money, but also facing medical expenses.\", \"created_utc\": 1588372124, \"permalink\": \"/r/Alabama/comments/gb54zy/over_7000_test_positive_for_covid19_across/fp7k3z4/\"} \n",

They've already announced if you are called back to work and refuse, you will be disqualified. They've also introduced a new system for employers to make it easier on them to report who is returning and who refused. If you do not go back and actually quit, your employer will submit your information to that effect. Also please be honest when you file your weekly certifications. Unemployment will then disqualify you and you will no longer receive payment. You can appeal at that time with the reasons you gave and go through that process but be ready for it to take a while. If they approve your appeal, you will get backpay for any weeks you certified (you should keep doing that). Your boss does pay for unemployment. Not the full amount you're getting but they do pay into it. PPP loan/grant also is given to retain his employees so he has to call everyone back but if you refuse to go back, that's not on him. He will need to make sure you quit. My advice for best case scenario? Talk to your employer ONLY through email/text, some kind of written form of communication so you can use it in your appeal. Before you go back, cite the reasons you gave and have him reply his denial of keeping the office closed. Since he says he'll have PPE on monday, go to work. If there are no PPE available, have proof of it (send him an email or text requesting PPE so he can reply and say he doesn't have it) and you can leave. Tell him you would like to be furloughed until adequate protection for yourself is in. That's a start. You can go to work every single day and leave when there is no equipment provided. That way you didn't refuse to work and you're leaving for COVID related reason. You're employed and he doesn't have to worry about firing you. Just keep proof of everything.
